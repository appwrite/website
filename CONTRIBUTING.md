# Contributing

We would ‚ù§Ô∏è you to contribute to Appwrite and help make it better! We want contributing to Appwrite to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including issues, and new docs, as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

## How to Start?

If you are worried or don‚Äôt know where to start, check out the next section that explains what kind of help we could use and where you can get involved. You can send your questions to [@appwrite](https://twitter.com/appwrite) on Twitter or to anyone from the [Appwrite team on Discord](https://appwrite.io/discord). You can also submit an issue, and a maintainer can guide you!

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Appwrite open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submit a Pull Request üöÄ

Branch naming convention is as following

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with the description of the changes made!**

For¬†the¬†initial¬†start, fork the project and¬†use¬†git¬†clone¬†command¬†to¬†download¬†the¬†repository¬†to¬†your¬†computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create a new branch from `master` like: `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`.<br/>

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat (make sure you're on the correct branch!)

4. Before you push your changes, make sure your code follows the coding standards, which is the standard that Appwrite currently follows. You can easily do this by running the formatter.

```bash
pnpm format
```

Now, go a step further by running the linter using the following command to manually fix the issues the formatter wasn't able to.

```bash
pnpm lint
```

5. Push changes to GitHub.

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

6. Submit your changes for review
   If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
7. Start a Pull Request
   Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.
8. Get a code review approval/reject.
9. After approval, merge your PR.
10. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored).

## Setup From Source

To set up a working **development environment**, just fork the project git repository and install the dependencies follow these commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_FORK_HERE]/website.git

cd website

pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Get Started

After finishing the installation process, you can start writing and editing code.

#### Advanced Topics

We love to create issues that are good for beginners and label them as `good first issue` or `hacktoberfest`, but some more advanced topics might require extra knowledge. Below is a list of links you can use to learn about the more advanced topics that will help you master the Appwrite codebase.

## Package Managers

This project uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) for managing dependencies.

## Coding Standards

We use prettier for our JS coding standards and auto-formatting for our code.

## Other Ways to Help

Pull requests are great, but there are many other ways you can help Appwrite.

### Blogging & Speaking

Mention [@appwrite](https://twitter.com/appwrite) on Twitter and/or [email team@appwrite.io](mailto:team@appwrite.io) so we can give pointers and tips and help you spread the word by promoting your content on the different Appwrite communication channels. Please add your blog posts and videos of talks to our [Awesome Appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite/awesome-appwrite) repo on GitHub.

### Presenting at Meetups

We encourage our contributors to present at meetups and conferences about your Appwrite projects. Your unique challenges and successes in building things with Appwrite can provide great speaking material. We‚Äôd love to review your talk abstract/CFP, so get in touch with us if you‚Äôd like some help!

### Sending Feedbacks and Reporting Bugs

Sending feedback is a great way for us to understand your different use cases of Appwrite better. If you had any issues, bugs, or want to share your experience, feel free to do so on our GitHub issues page or at our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA).

### Submitting New Ideas

If you think Appwrite could use a new feature, please open an issue on our GitHub repository, stating as much information as you have about your new idea and its implications. We would also use this issue to gather more information, get more feedback from the community, and have a proper discussion about the new feature.
