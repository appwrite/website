# Contributing

We would ‚ù§Ô∏è you to contribute to the Appwrite website and help make it better! We want contributing to Appwrite to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. This document will walk you through the steps to complete your first contribution.

## Code of conduct

Help us keep Appwrite open and inclusive. Before interacting with the Appwrite community, please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/appwrite/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Find an issue

Looking for a place to start? Have a feature request or bug report? Start with by searching through our [issues](https://github.com/appwrite/website/issues).

If you're looking for a good issue to start contributing, simple issues fit for first time contributors will be labelled `good first issue`. More challenging issues might be labelled `help wanted`.

If you want to request features, improvements, or bug fixes, **search for existing issues first**. If you find a similar issue, comment and upvote the issue for visibility. If you cannot find a similar issues, open a new issue. If the Appwrite maintainers think the issue is an issue appropriate for contribution, we'll mark it as `help wanted`.

## Fork and clone

To contribute to the Appwrite website, you need to fork, clone, and run the website.

Start by [forking the repository](https://github.com/appwrite/website/fork), which makes a copy of the repo on your GitHub profile. This allows you to make code changes when you don't have permissions in the main Appwrite website repo.

Then, [clone the respository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository).

Alternatively, you can develop the website repo in your browser using [Code Spaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/#https://github.com/appwrite/website).

## Development

The Appwrite website uses [PNPM](https://pnpm.io). Start by following their [installation](https://pnpm.io/installation) documentation.

Once you've cloned the Appwrite website repo, running the following command to install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

Then, run the following command to start a development server.

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Before commiting your code changes, make sure the website repo builds by running:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

## Submit a pull request üöÄ

The branch naming convention is as follows

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with a description of the changes made!**

Start by forking the project and use the `git clone` command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream to make sure your default branch is up to date.

```
git pull
```

2. Create a new branch from the default branch. For example `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

```
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )
4. Push changes to GitHub

```
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

6. Submit your changes for review. If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
7. Start a Pull Request (PR) by clicking on `Create pull request`. Make sure to update the PR description following the template provided.
8. Wait for a code review.
9. If you need to make changes based on feedback, make sure to re-request a review from your reviewer after you've made the necessary changes.

![Re-Request a Review](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-4714/images/help/pull_requests/request-re-review.png)

10. After approval, your PR will be merged.
