In the last few years, Golang (or Go) has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages for developers building cloud-native applications. With Appwrite 1.6, we have introduced a new runtime to let developers build Appwrite Functions with Go.

# How Appwrite Functions and Go complement each other

There are several reasons why Appwrite Functions and Go form a rather handy option for your product development toolkit:

## Highly performant (due to compiled nature)

In our internal benchmark, while the larger codebase and compiled nature of Go leads to slower builds, our Go runtime showed up to 3 times faster cold-start times compared to interpreted languages.  Additionally, it demonstrated 5 times less memory consumption than any other runtime, including Node.js, Dart, PHP, and Python.

## Open-source runtime(s)

Our Go runtime (just like our other runtimes) has been developed by our team and is [open-sourced](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes/tree/main/runtimes/go), which allows a simpler feedback and contribution mechanism and enables improvement of the runtime at a much higher pace.

## Event-driven nature

Appwrite Functions can be executed by various types of events, which allows you to integrate them into your applications in many different ways. These events include all HTTP actions (to consume like a REST API), CRON schedules (to run them on set time periods), and any events across the various Appwrite products in your project (for example, user creation, document deletion, or file upload).

## Global environment variables

Aside from environment variables at the function level, Appwrite also allows you to environment variables at the project level so that they can be shared across multiple functions in a single project. 

## Permissions system

Appwrite’s permissions system for products such as Databases and Storage also extends to Functions, providing an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized users from consuming your functions.

## Local development support

With our latest release, Appwrite has released support for [local development](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-local-development), allowing users to test and debug their Appwrite Functions on their devices without deploying to an Appwrite instance. For the Go runtime, we have also released a module containing all the necessary types for the Functions runtime, making it even easier to develop Go-based Appwrite Functions in your preferred code editor.

## CI/CD with GitHub

Appwrite offers CI/CD support for Appwrite Functions through GitHub, simplifying your developer experience by automating the process of pushing your function to your Appwrite project.

# Building Go functions

To use Go in Appwrite, you need to use the latest version of Appwrite. You can either [sign up on Appwrite Cloud](https://appwrite.io/cloud) or [self-host](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) Appwrite 1.6 with the `go-1.23` runtime added to your [environment](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/environment-variables#functions:~:text=preserve%20harddrive%20health.-,_APP_FUNCTIONS_RUNTIMES,-version%20%3E%3D%200.8.0%20This). The runtime will be available on Appwrite Cloud after Init. Next, go ahead and create a Go function using the [Appwrite CLI](https://appwrite.io/docs/tooling/command-line/installation#Installation) by running `appwrite init function`.

Once your function is set up, we can try some examples:

## Example 1: AI Chatbot using GPT-3.5

The first example is a simple chatbot function that accepts a prompt in the request body and returns an answer in the response from the ChatGPT API. 

To do this, we must first add the `go-openai` dependency to our project’s `mod` file.

```bash
go get github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai
```

Then, we can use it to create our chatbot function logic in the `main.go` file, where we get the prompt from our request body, send it to the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo model), and return a response to the client.

```go
package handler

import (
	"context"
	"os"

	"github.com/open-runtimes/types-for-go/v4/openruntimes"
	openai "github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai"
)

type RequestBody struct {
	Prompt string `json:"prompt"`
}

// This Appwrite function will be executed every time your function is triggered
func Main(Context openruntimes.Context) openruntimes.Response {
	openAiKey := os.Getenv("OPENAI_KEY")

	openAiClient := openai.NewClient(openAiKey)

	if Context.Req.Method == "GET" {
		return Context.Res.Text("Send a POST request to this endpoint with a prompt and get a response.")
	}

	if Context.Req.Method == "POST" {
		var requestBody RequestBody
		err := Context.Req.BodyJson(&requestBody)

		if err != nil {
			Context.Error(err)
			return Context.Res.Json(map[string]interface{}{
				"ok":    false,
				"error": "Missing request body",
			}, Context.Res.WithStatusCode(400))
		}

		prompt := requestBody.Prompt

		completion, err := openAiClient.CreateChatCompletion(
			context.Background(),
			openai.ChatCompletionRequest{
				Model: openai.GPT3Dot5Turbo,
				Messages: []openai.ChatCompletionMessage{
					{
						Role:    openai.ChatMessageRoleUser,
						Content: prompt,
					},
				},
			},
		)

		if err != nil {
			Context.Error(err)
			return Context.Res.Json(map[string]interface{}{
				"ok":    false,
				"error": err.Error(),
			}, Context.Res.WithStatusCode(500))
		}

		return Context.Res.Json(map[string]interface{}{
			"ok":       true,
			"response": completion.Choices[0].Message.Content,
		})
	}

	return Context.Res.Json(map[string]interface{}{
		"ok":    false,
		"error": "Bad request",
	}, Context.Res.WithStatusCode(400))
}
```

You can then deploy this function using the `appwrite deploy function` command.

## Example 2: HTML Resume

The second example is an online HTML-based resume that you can deliver online through the function. 

For this, the first thing we do is create a `static` directory in the function folder and add a file, `resume.html` with the contents of our resume. You can [copy our template](https://github.com/appwrite-community/go-function-examples/blob/main/functions/go-resume/static/resume.html) if you’d like.

Next, create our function logic in the `main.go` file, where we return this content with the appropriate headers so that a browser reads it as an HTML page.

```go
package handler

import (
	"embed"

	"github.com/open-runtimes/types-for-go/v4/openruntimes"
)

//go:embed static/*
var embedReader embed.FS

func Main(Context openruntimes.Context) openruntimes.Response {
	if Context.Req.Method == "GET" {

		resumeHtml, _ := embedReader.ReadFile(("static/resume.html"))

		Context.Log(resumeHtml)

		return Context.Res.Text(string(resumeHtml),
			Context.Res.WithStatusCode(200),
			Context.Res.WithHeaders(map[string]string{
				"Content-Type": "text/html",
			}))
	}
	return Context.Res.Text("Bad request", Context.Res.WithStatusCode(404))
}

```

You can then deploy this function using the `appwrite deploy function` command.

## Example 3: URL Shortener

The third example is a personal URL shortener that stores your shortened URL path and long URL in an Appwrite Database and redirects the consumer to the appropriate long URL on pinging the shortened URL. 

To build this function, create a `services` directory in the function folder and add a file `setup.go`. Here, we will add the necessary functions to initialize our Appwrite database.

```go
package services

import (
	"github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-go/databases"
	"github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-go/permission"
	"github.com/open-runtimes/types-for-go/v4/openruntimes"
)

func DoesDatabaseExist(dbs databases.Databases, dbId string) bool {
	_, err := dbs.Get(dbId)
	if err != nil {
		return false
	}
	return true
}

func DoesCollectionExist(dbs databases.Databases, dbId string, collId string) bool {
	_, err := dbs.GetCollection(dbId, collId)
	if err != nil {
		return false
	}
	return true
}

func DoesAttributeExist(dbs databases.Databases, dbId string, collId string, attribId string) bool {
	_, err := dbs.GetAttribute(dbId, collId, attribId)
	if err != nil {
		return false
	}
	return true
}

func InitialiseDatabase(Context openruntimes.Context, dbs databases.Databases, dbId string, collId string) {
	doesDbExist := DoesDatabaseExist(dbs, dbId)
	if !doesDbExist {
		dbs.Create(
			dbId,
			"URL Databases",
		)
	}

	doesCollExist := DoesCollectionExist(dbs, dbId, collId)
	if !doesCollExist {
		dbs.CreateCollection(
			dbId,
			collId,
			"URLs",
			dbs.WithCreateCollectionPermissions([]string{permission.Read("any")}),
		)
	}

	doesAttribExist := DoesAttributeExist(dbs, dbId, collId, "longUrl")
	if !doesAttribExist {
		dbs.CreateUrlAttribute(
			dbId,
			collId,
			"longUrl",
			true,
			dbs.WithCreateUrlAttributeArray(false),
		)
	}
}
```

After that, we create the function logic in the `main.go` file, where each `POST` request stores the shortened URL path and the relevant long URL in the Appwrite database, and each `GET` request to the saved (shortened) URL path redirects the user to the relevant long URL.

```go
package handler

import (
	"openruntimes/handler/services"
	"os"

	"github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-go/appwrite"
	"github.com/open-runtimes/types-for-go/v4/openruntimes"
)

type RequestBody struct {
	ShortId string `json:"shortId"`
	LongUrl string `json:"longUrl"`
}

type ResponseBody struct {
	LongUrl string `json:"longUrl"`
}

func Main(Context openruntimes.Context) openruntimes.Response {
	client := appwrite.NewClient(
		appwrite.WithEndpoint(os.Getenv("APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_ENDPOINT")),
		appwrite.WithProject(os.Getenv("APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID")),
		appwrite.WithKey(Context.Req.Headers["x-appwrite-key"]),
	)

	databases := appwrite.NewDatabases(client)

	dbId := "urlDatabase"
	collId := "urlCollection"

	services.InitialiseDatabase(Context, *databases, dbId, collId)

	if Context.Req.Method == "POST" {
		var requestBody RequestBody
		err := Context.Req.BodyJson(&requestBody)
		if err != nil {
			Context.Error(err)
			return Context.Res.Json(map[string]interface{}{
				"ok":    false,
				"error": "Missing request body",
			}, Context.Res.WithStatusCode(400))
		}

		_, err = databases.CreateDocument(
			dbId,
			collId,
			requestBody.ShortId,
			map[string]interface{}{
				"longUrl": requestBody.LongUrl,
			},
		)

		if err != nil {
			Context.Error(err)
			return Context.Res.Json(map[string]interface{}{
				"ok":    false,
				"error": "Failed to create shortened URL",
			}, Context.Res.WithStatusCode(500))
		}

		return Context.Res.Json(map[string]interface{}{
			"ok":      true,
			"shortId": requestBody.ShortId,
			"longUrl": requestBody.LongUrl,
		})
	}

	if Context.Req.Method == "GET" {
		path := Context.Req.Path
		if path == "/" {
			return Context.Res.Text("Welcome to the URL shortener service\n\nAdd a short URL to the path to redirect to the long URL\n", Context.Res.WithStatusCode(200))
		}

		shortId := path[1:]

		document, err := databases.GetDocument(dbId, collId, shortId)

		if err != nil {
			Context.Error(err)
			return Context.Res.Text("URL not found", Context.Res.WithStatusCode(404))
		}

		var responseBody ResponseBody
		document.Decode(&responseBody)

		return Context.Res.Redirect(responseBody.LongUrl, Context.Res.WithStatusCode(302))
	}
	return Context.Res.Empty()
}

```

You can then deploy this function using the `appwrite deploy function` command.

After deployment, go to the Settings tab on the Function page in your Appwrite project and enable the following scopes for the dynamic API key: `databases.read`, `databases.write`, `collections.read`, `collections.write`, `attributes.read`, `attributes.write`, `documents.read`, `documents.write`,
