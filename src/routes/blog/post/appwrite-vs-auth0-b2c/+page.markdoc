If you're building a consumer-facing app, authentication is one of the first things you'll need to solve, and it's also one of the easiest places to make long-term tradeoffs without realizing it. Once your app starts growing, you don't want your identity provider to be the thing holding you back, or quietly draining your budget.

Many developers reach for **Auth0** early on. It's a familiar name and has broad market adoption. But if you're planning to onboard tens of thousands of users, or even just aiming for that kind of growth, it's worth examining the pricing model closely. This is where **Appwrite** offers a very different approach that might serve your needs better as you scale.

# Why MAU-based pricing bites B2C apps

Both Auth0 and Appwrite use **Monthly Active Users (MAUs)** to set authentication limits, but how they handle those limits is very different.

Auth0's pricing climbs quickly as your user base grows:

- **Free**: $0 for up to 25,000 MAUs (feature-limited)
- **Essentials**: $35/month for 500 MAUs (a significant drop with more features)
- **Professional**: $240/month for 1,000 MAUs
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing, often kicking in around 20,000 MAUs

At that point, you're typically required to enter a custom agreement.

For B2C products, especially those still vaapplidating their revenue model, this kind of scale-up cost can create real friction. You're paying more simply because more users signed in, not necessarily because you're consuming more backend resources.

# Appwrite keeps auth limits generous and pricing predictable

Appwrite also tracks MAUs for auth limits, but its approach is more transparent and less aggressive as you scale.

- **Free**: $0 for up to 75,000 MAUs
- **Pro**: $15/month for up to 200,000 MAUs
- **Scale**: $599/month for higher usage
- **Additional MAUs**: $3 per 1,000 beyond your plan limit

You're only billed beyond that when your app consumes more **compute, storage, or bandwidth**, not just because more people log in. That lets you absorb growth without a sudden budget hit and gives you levers to control cost based on your architecture and usage patterns.

# Migrating data without lock-in

If you're migrating from another platform, Appwrite supports importing user accounts, including [hashed passwords](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/password-hashing-algorithms). That means your users don't need to reset their passwords when you make the switch.

You can also move from [**Appwrite Cloud**](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) to a **self-hosted deployment** later, using the same SDKs and APIs. Your code doesn't change, just the endpoint. That kind of portability is usually locked behind enterprise agreements in other platforms.

# What you get in practice

Here's how the two platforms compare on features that matter most for growing B2C apps:

| **Capability** | **Appwrite** | **Auth0** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pricing model** | Resource-based, with auth limits set by MAUs | MAU-based, with steep price jumps |
| **Self-hosting** | Fully supported | Enterprise-only via Private Cloud |
| **Open source** | Yes | No |
| **MFA** | Built-in (TOTP with email or authenticator app) | Multiple factors (SMS, push, biometrics) |
| **Permissions and RBAC** | Available on all plans; organization roles on Scale+ | Full RBAC available on higher tiers |
| **Session limits** | Configurable TTLs, per-device controls | Supported; depth varies by plan |
| **Auth methods** | Email/password, social login, OAuth, phone, anonymous, magic URL, LDAP | Email/password, social login, passkeys, SAML, MFA |
| **Extensibility** | Serverless functions, custom auth logic | Rules engine, actions (plan-dependent) |

Auth0 supports integrations like passkeys out of the box. But if you're focused on launch, growth, and cost control, Appwrite covers the core use cases, without locking critical features behind high pricing tiers.

# What it looks like at 100,000 MAUs

Let's say your app hits 100,000 monthly active users:

- **Auth0**: Transparent pricing only goes up to 20,000 MAUs at $1400. Beyond that, you need to contact the sales team and might have to sign an enterprise contract. Some users have reported paying **as much as $13,000/month** at this scale.
- **Appwrite**: Still on the [**$15/month Pro plan**](https://appwrite.io/pricing), assuming your resource usage is within limits. Even with overages, your total cost is likely to stay **well under $100/month**.

This is not just about affordability but about pricing that reflects actual usage and not only user count, so you're not penalized for gaining traction.

# Wrapping up

Authentication is foundational, and the wrong choice can quietly shape how your app grows, or stalls. Auth0 might be the more popular choice, but if you're building a B2C product, Appwrite gives you more room to move.

With Appwrite, you get core auth features, generous limits, and the ability to self-host when you're ready, all with pricing that scales with usage, not just sign-ins. That makes it easier to focus on product and not platform constraints.
