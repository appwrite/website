# What is Hacktoberfest

Welcome to Hacktoberfest – a global event that unites tech enthusiasts from every corner of the globe to celebrate open-source software.

Hacktoberfest isn't just an event, it's a testament to the incredible impact that contributors can make in the open-source community. It's a time when the digital realm comes alive with the buzz of creativity and camaraderie, where individuals of all backgrounds and expertise levels come together to contribute their skills and passion to open-source projects.

In this blog, we'll explore the significance of Hacktoberfest in the open-source community. We'll highlight how it guides newcomers and seasoned developers toward collaboration and shared knowledge. Additionally, we'll showcase inspiring success stories that exemplify the true spirit of open source.

Now, let's dive into some real-life stories of contributors who have participated in Hacktoberfest and experienced the transformative power of open-source collaboration.

# Inspiring stories from the community

### A journey of discovery and connection

The first story is from [Sarthak Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarthakroy2002/), who says, “Well, I started using GitHub properly from February 2021. Hacktoberfest was the reason I found out Appwrite and many more orgs/tools/services in 2021 October. Then I started exploring various stuffs and learnt a ton. During Hacktoberfest 2022, I again contributed in multiple projects, including Appwrite. It all started with the hope of getting a swag in 2021, to enjoying open source and contributing. It also helped me connect with some amazing folks. ”

Sarthak's story highlights the transformative power of Hacktoberfest, from initially participating for the swag to discovering the joy of open source and connecting with amazing people.

### Inspiring journey: From novice to maintainer

Next, let's hear from Moumita Roy, who had an amazing experience with Hacktoberfest. In her own words, "Well, first, I participated in Hacktoberfest 2022 after a friend encouraged me to register for it. Before that, I only knew that GitHub was for pushing code. But through Hacktoberfest, I learned about schemas and other terminologies. Since then, I have contributed to numerous open-source projects. I'm grateful to my friend for introducing me to the world of open source. As a student, I'm still learning and excited about Hacktoberfest 2023. This year, I plan to contribute and participate as a maintainer." Now, let's dive into Moumita's inspiring journey.

### Embracing the open-source culture

The final story is from Krishnendu Dasgupta and he says, “One of the best things about Hacktoberfest for me is that it helped me become familiar with and accustomed to the open-source culture. I can still vividly remember Hacktoberfest 2018, when I was asking questions like "What is GitHub?" and learning about version control and collaboration through Git and GitHub. This experience was life-changing, as it continues to enable me to collaborate effectively with my teammates on any project.”

Krishnendu added: “Another valuable lesson from events like Hacktoberfest is that open source is not just about making significant feature contributions or bringing about major changes. Every contribution matters, as long as it adds value to the main codebase.Last but not least, even if I didn't directly contribute to certain repositories, simply browsing through them made me realize the importance of maintaining good coding practices.”

He further explained, “Overall, Hacktoberfest is definitely an event worth participating in. It was an eye-opener for me, highlighting the significance of collaboration and creating something great for others!”

From the above stories, one thing is common: everyone needs to start from somewhere, and for them, that somewhere was Hacktoberfest! If you are someone who is looking to get started in open source, this is your chance!
