Welcome back to the November product update. This month is different. If you caught our Open Letter, you already know where we're heading: Appwrite is no longer just a backend. With Appwrite Sites, we're taking a real step toward the most complete cloud platform to date.

And on top of that, we've shipped a stack of upgrades across Databases, plus a new ElevenLabs template to add voice to your apps in minutes.

So, here's what to expect:

- DB operators
- Database AI suggestions
- Skipping total counts for faster list queries
- Disable image transformations for buckets
- Next.js standalone builds support

Let's dive in.

# An open letter to Appwrite Community

This month, we shared something bigger than a feature release: our vision for where Appwrite is heading. In our **Open Letter**, Eldad breaks down how Appwrite is evolving from a backend platform into a full **developers' cloud** that supports the entire product journey: imagine → build → deploy → observe → protect.

If you want the full story behind why Sites matters and where the platform is going next, you should definitely give it a read.

![Database AI suggestions](/images/blog/product-update-november-2025/ai-suggestions.png)

# Database AI suggestions

Starting with an empty table can be slow, repetitive, and time-consuming. With Database AI suggestions, you get the option to use suggested columns and indexes the moment you name your table.

That means:

- No more blank schemas - Appwrite suggests sensible columns you can use.
- Faster setup - Go from table name to schema in seconds.
- You're in control - Review, tweak, or skip the suggestions.

![DB operators](/images/blog/product-update-november-2025/db-operators.png)

# DB operators

Now you don't have to fetch an entire row just to bump a number or tweak a tag list.

With DB Operators, you can now send inline, atomic update instructions directly in your Update or Upsert call. No race conditions. No bulky payloads. Now live on Appwrite Cloud.

![ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech template](/images/blog/product-update-november-2025/elevenlabs.png)

# ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech template

You can now add a real, human-like AI voice to your apps using Appwrite Sites with our new ElevenLabs integration.

And the best part? We've shipped a ready-to-use Appwrite Sites template built with ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API.

![Skip total counts](/images/blog/product-update-november-2025/skip-totals.png)

# Skip total counts for faster list queries

A new way to optimize your Appwrite Databases. You can now skip total counting on list endpoints with a simple `total=false` flag and get faster, lighter list responses without the extra database work.

[Learn more from the documentation](/docs/products/databases/pagination#skip-totals)

![Next.js standalone builds](/images/blog/product-update-november-2025/nextjs.png)

# Next.js standalone builds are now supported on Appwrite Sites

You can now deploy Next.js apps built in [standalone mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output) on Appwrite Sites, with full support for Next.js 16. In standalone mode, the build process creates a smaller package that includes only the files your app needs to run in production, leaving out development tools and unused parts of the framework.

# Disable image transformations for buckets

Image transformations allow actions like resizing, cropping, and format conversion through the Appwrite Storage API. With this new update, you have full control to turn off these operations when they're not needed, reducing the chance of unintentional processing or costs.

# Community recognitions

We're excited to feature [Appwrite ORM](https://appwrite-orm.online/) as part of our Monthly Community recognitions this month.

A powerful TypeScript ORM that adds type safety, automatic migrations, and smooth developer workflows on top of Appwrite.

A big shout-out to [Ori Raisfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ori-raisfeld-422392264/).

If you'd like to participate in next month's Community Recognitions, [join our Discord server](https://appwrite.io/discord) to showcase your project.
