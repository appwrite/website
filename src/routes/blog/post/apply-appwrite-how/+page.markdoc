At Appwrite, we’re building more than open-source backend tools, we’re building a people-first, innovation-driven company that thrives on collaboration, creativity, and community. Every job application we receive is a potential new chapter in our story, and we want to give you the best chance of joining the team.

We get it: applying for jobs is tough. Whether you're shooting your shot at one company or juggling ten applications at once, we appreciate your time and effort. That said, we want to help you stand out, for the right reasons.

Here are some pointers to keep in mind when applying to Appwrite.

# Show us your work

Include everything relevant to the role: GitHub repos, websites, portfolios, articles, whatever shows your skill, creativity, and experience. We’re not just hiring based on a resume; we want to see what you’ve built or contributed to.

# Use AI (but make it *you*)

We believe AI is an incredible tool, and yes, it’s fine to use it to help structure your application. But AI is only a tool. It should *start* with you and *end* with you. Copy-pasting a ChatGPT answer doesn’t show us your voice, and trust us, it’s easy to spot. Innovation and originality matter here. Think of AI as your co-pilot, not your ghostwriter.

# Put effort into the application form

We know application forms can feel tedious. But at Appwrite, we *don't* ask filler questions. Every single one has been crafted with purpose. We're not trying to trip you up or test your ability to write a five-paragraph essay, instead, we're giving you space to tell us who you are, how you think, and why this role excites you. Think of the application form as your first collaboration with Appwrite. It’s a chance to show us how you show up, and if that aligns with the way we build together.

# Do your research

Learn about Appwrite’s [open-source philosophy](https://github.com/appwrite), check out our [documentation](/docs), and explore our [community](/discord). This isn't about name-dropping features, it’s about showing you care enough to understand what we’re building and how you can be a part of it.

# Align with our values

We are people-first. We care deeply about our community, our team, and our impact. Innovation isn't just about cool tech, it’s about challenging norms, asking better questions, and supporting each other along the way. If you connect with that, let us know. We're listening.

# Be yourself

Whether you're a career-switcher, self-taught, or traditionally trained, we value diverse paths. Tell us what makes you *you*. There’s no one-size-fits-all here, we’re looking for talent, heart, and hunger to grow.

# Before You Hit Submit

We're grateful for the interest we receive with every job opening and we take each application seriously. Behind every application is a person, and behind Appwrite is a team of people committed to building something impactful, together.

We work hard, support one another, and stay focused on delivering real value. We don't just chase trends; we create tools that enable others to build with purpose. That takes dedication, creativity, and people who want to do meaningful work in an environment that respects and challenges them.

When you apply, don’t aim for perfection, aim for authenticity. Be thoughtful. Be curious. Be you.
