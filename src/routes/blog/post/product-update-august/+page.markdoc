# Local Development

On day 0, we released Local Development, which allows you to develop and test functions on your local machine.

Running functions locally has many benefits. Local development allows faster debugging, a quicker feedback loop, and a better overall experience. When running your function locally during development, you are more likely to test it every step of the way instead of shipping multiple big changes all at once.

Watch the product tour for more, or visit our [documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/develop-locally) to get started.

# New Appwrite CLI

A good, easy-to-use CLI makes all the difference in your experience, so we're really excited to introduce a new version of the Appwrite CLI.

It allows you to test your functions locally, easily migrate databases, and more.

The new CLI’s main features are:

- **Local development**: Test your Appwrite function locally
- **Data sync**: Push and pull data between Appwrite and your CLI in a non-destructive way.
- **Headless login**: Login to your Appwrite account in a non-interactive manner for CI/CD pipelines

Besides those features, this release includes many bug fixes and optimizations.

# Functions ecosystem

Appwrite loves Functions, so it's with great pleasure that we're introducing a host of new updates to the Functions ecosystem.

- Faster Functions cold-starts
- Dynamic API keys
- Delayed executions
- Binary executions
- Execution and deployment filtering

Functions are now faster, smoother, better, and more secure.

# Go support

We've added a Go SDK and Function runtime to allow you to take advantage of Go’s speed to handle complex tasks like calculations, statistics, or file transformations more efficiently. The new runtime allowed for up to 3x faster cold starts and a base execution time of less than 1 millisecond. That means your functions will start running much quicker, and once they're up, they'll fly.

## What can you build with Go?

Are you excited to start building with Go? Here are a few use cases to get you started:

- **Create APIs:** Build RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **Process data:** Handle complex data transformations and analysis.
- **Image processing:** Resize, crop, or filter images on the fly.
- **File conversion:** Convert files between different formats.
- **Machine learning:** Deploy machine learning models for real-time predictions.

# Mock numbers & Session alerts

We've listened to your feedback and are introducing two new features to simplify phone authentication testing and bolster account security.

Mock numbers allow you to set up a list of phone numbers with a predefined, static verification code, which is perfect for app reviews and testing. Session alerts will help your users maintain their account security.
