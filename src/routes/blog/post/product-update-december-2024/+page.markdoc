# Products and features highlights 2024

In 2024, we added many products and features that many of you needed for your projects. Some of them essentials, like Messaging, and some of them part of the future hype, like AI integrations. But, whatever we released, we wanted to give you the tools to build the products you envisioned. Here is a recap of the top products of 2024.

## Messaging - Communicate with your users directly from the Appwrite console

Adding Messaging to Appwrite was a big game changer in 2024. Not only does it make us the only open-source BaaS with this product, but it also was a product that many of you directly asked for. Just connect an integrator such as Sendgrid or Twilio to Appwrite, and you can start sending messages within minutes. In 2025, we plan to add push notifications that will give you more flexibility.

## MFA - Extra layer of security 

Who doesn’t love a security-tight application? With MFA, we introduced TOTP, emails, and SMS methods to add an extra security step for your users. To lead by example, we also added it to the Appwrite Console. Be sure to turn it on!

## Appwrite AI - Build AI-powered applications

In May, we announced multiple AI Integrations to help developers build AI apps. With pre-built functions and an enhanced knowledge base, you can easily add features like natural language processing (NLP), image analysis, and audio processing to your projects. 

Integrate with popular AI tools like Pinecone, OpenAI and Perplexity, among others to supercharge your projects with advanced AI features. Check out all the cool AI projects built with Appwrite [here](https://builtwith.appwrite.io/search/?useCase=ai)

## New Appwrite CLI - Speed up your development process

A CLI can be your best friend if done right. The [new version](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/introducing-new-appwrite-cli) was a more than welcome addition and has made developing applications with Appwrite a lot more enjoyable.

No more overwriting or deleting existing collection data during deployments. With the new Appwrite CLI, you can test functions locally and push or pull data between Appwrite and your CLI seamlessly without affecting existing data.

## Improved SSR support - Implement SSR authentication with ease

Lack of access to session secrets made SSR complex, leaving devs to rely on hacky and undocumented methods. With SSR support, Appwrite now securely manages session secrets server-side, making [SSR implementation](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/introducing-support-for-server-side-rendering) simple.

## Database backups - Secure your databases

Data is your most valuable asset, and safeguarding it is incredibly important. That’s why we introduced [Database Backups](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/introducing-database-backups), which allows you to take a backup of your database. These backups are hot and encrypted, ensuring maximum security with no downtime.

## Roles - Improve your team collaboration and security

In September, we launched the much-requested [Roles](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-roles-for-enhanced-collaboration-and-security) feature, making it easy for larger teams to manage access. Alongside the "Owner" role, new options include Developer, Editor, Analyst, and Billing. 

Custom roles are on the way, giving you even more control. Stay tuned.

![Integrations catalog](/images/blog/product-update-december-2024/integrations.png)

# Integrations catalog

We launched the Integrations Catalog with a ton of popular integrations like Stripe, OpenAI, Huggingface, GitHub, and more. These integrations let you add payments, AI capabilities, and other cool things, taking your projects to the next level.

We will continue to update the catalog with more integrations. You can also apply to become a [Technology partner](https://appwrite.io/integrations/technology-partner) and get your integration listed in the catalog. Check out the catalog [here](https://appwrite.io/integrations).

# Programs

We’re committed to helping developers build the future, which is why we introduced two programs for founders who can use some help reducing their costs and students who want to get acquainted with the newest technologies.

## Appwrite Startup Program

We launched the Appwrite Startup Program to support startups with a reliable backend, enabling them to scale faster and build smarter. Backed by Techstars and multiple venture studios, many innovative startups are already part of the program.
