It’s the first week of a new month, which means it’s time to reflect on all the wonderful things that happened in June. Read on to learn more about our public roadmap, Appwriters out in the wild, and dev tools to boost your productivity.

# Public roadmap

![Appwrite's public roadmap](/images/blog/product-update-june/public-roadmap.png)

This month, we launched the new public roadmap on GitHub. It is part of our commitment to transparency with the Appwrite community. It enables:

- Increased transparency in our product priorities
- Direct feedback route for the community
- Further clarity in timelines to set expectations

The roadmap is designed to help us increase collaboration among the core team, contributors, maintainers, and Appwrite developers.

# The Appwriter is out!

Appwrite community members have started to receive their Appwriters, and the reviews are in! People love it. 

![Appwriter testimonials](/images/blog/product-update-june/appwriter-testimonials.png)

We’re very proud of the overwhelmingly positive feedback from the community. Our team has worked tirelessly for the past six months to ensure that every detail, from the packaging to every key press, is perfect. 

The Appwriter will be available for pre-order on the Appwrite store today! [Visit our store](https://apwr.dev/store) to place your pre-order.

Does this mean we’re also a hardware company now?

# Appwrite Messaging

![Messaging page](/images/blog/product-update-june/messaging-page.png)

Appwrite’s newest product Messaging now has its own product page (the first of its kind!). Messaging allows you to set up email, SMS and push notifications to your users from a single API. 

You can find more in-depth information on how messaging works and even play around with the interactive animations.
