This has to be the best time in history to start a business. With so many advancements in AI tools and agents, it has never been this easy to build and scale your startup. The next breed of billion-dollar companies will be tiny teams backed by AI agents and workflows.

And one such recent advancement is Model Context Protocol (MCP), which has gone viral for the past couple of months and is a significant breakthrough in how LLMs(Large Language Models) interact with external tools.

In this blog, we'll cover MCP and five startup ideas that you can start building today.

# What is MCP?
Forget the fancy words for a second.

MCP is just a way for AI assistants to interact with real-world tools like databases, file systems, APIs, and apps.

Currently, AI assistants can reason, process information, and answer questions but don't know where anything is and can't actually do anything outside of its box.

Now imagine you give it a phone with direct lines to your company's database, your Slack account, your email inbox, and your documents.

That's exactly what MCP does.

It's the system that allows an AI assistant to:
- Fetch real data.
- Look up information from live sources.
- Trigger actions (like posting messages, running queries, or updating records).

Instead of just guessing based on past knowledge, the AI can now pull actual facts from the places that matter.

MCP is just the standardized way of making this happen. Instead of every AI needing custom integrations for every tool, MCP provides one universal way to hook everything together.

MCP was developed by Anthropic and released as an open standard in November 2024, making it a relatively new but rapidly growing solution.

We've covered everything you need to know about MCP in a recent [blog](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/what-is-mcp), but let's dive into 5 MCP or AI agents startup opportunities you can start building today.

# 1. MCP App Store
Create an MCP APP Store, where users can browse and deploy various MCP servers. Think of it like an app store, but for MCP servers. Developers could look through different MCP servers, find the ones they need, and deploy them with just a few clicks.

The idea is to simplify the process of integrating different services with LLMs, making it much easier for anyone to use the power of MCP without having to deal with the technical complexity.

# 2. Incident Tracer
When your app breaks, whether it's a bug or an outage, an MCP agent traces every log, commit, and Slack message to give you a full incident report in seconds. So, instead of manually digging through logs or trying to piece together what went wrong, the MCP agent automatically collects all the relevant information, creating a detailed report that helps you quickly understand the issue.

# 3. Task Assistant
An MCP-powered agent that shadows founders, reading emails, meetings, tasks, and documents. It provides daily summaries and suggests the next best actions, acting like your personal Chief of Staff. This allows founders to stay focused on what matters while it keeps track of everything and ensures nothing slips through the cracks.

# 4. Dev Onboarder
DevOnboarder onboards devs 10x faster by spinning up an agent trained on your internal codebase, docs, and Slack threads. So, instead of spending weeks, the tool can help new devs get familiar with the system and start contributing right away, cutting down on the time spent training and ramping up.

# 5. AI Changelog
AIChangelog tracks everything every AI agent does and why, creating a detailed, auditable record. It keeps a running log of every action taken, ensuring full transparency and accountability for agent teams. It helps you trace every step, providing clarity and insight into how your AI agents are performing.

# Conclusion

MCP changes everything. Before, AI agents were isolated. Now, they connect, collaborate, and scale. This is a huge opportunity to build AI agents and create connected, intelligent solutions that automate tasks, streamline processes, and solve real-world problems.

The Appwrite's Startups Program can help you do that with the tools and support you need to create these AI-driven products. [Apply today](appwrite.io/startups) and start building.
