Time and time again, we've seen that startups that change and adapt to market needs are the ones who win big. However, with startups using traditional software products, it becomes increasingly difficult to pivot. High costs, vendor lock-in, limited control, and flexibility can hold them back to do so.

That's why open-source, self-hostable software products are becoming the go-to choice for many startups and enterprises as they offer the control, flexibility, and scalability that traditional software solutions simply can't match.

In this blog, we'll learn about open-source, it's benefits and 10 open-source product alternatives for your startup.

# What is open-source?

In simple words, open-source software is made available with a license that allows anyone to view, modify, and in some cases also distribute its source code.

Unlike traditional software, which is owned and controlled by a company, open-source products gives you full access to the code, so you can customize the software to meet your specific needs.

# Benefits of open-source software

While the huge benefit of an open-source product is the ability to customize it according to your needs, there are many other benefits to consider, like:

## Cost savings
Open-source products generally offer budget-friendly options for businesses of all sizes. Many open-source projects are free to get started and you can pay as you scale or need  additional support, which could be a great option for budget-tight teams.

## Community support
Open-source projects generally have a large and active community, with members who are always ready to help. This makes it easy to troubleshoot and get help when needed.

## No vendor lock-in

With an open-source product, you can have more control over the tech stack and reduce the risk of being trapped by a vendor's decisions. So you don't have to get dependent on a single vendor and migrate whenever needed.

## More control over your data

Most open-source projects have self-hostable versions that allow you to host the software on your own servers, giving you full control over your data and how it's stored.
