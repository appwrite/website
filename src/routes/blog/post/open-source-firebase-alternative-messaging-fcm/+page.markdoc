With Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) officially deprecated in June 2024, developers are now faced with a crucial decision: migrate to FCM’s newer API or explore open-source alternatives.

In this blog, we’ll compare Firebase Cloud Messaging with Appwrite’s Messaging service, an open-source alternative to push notifications, to help you understand the key differences and advantages so you can choose the best solution for your project.

# FCM deprecation and what it means

As of June 2024, Firebase officially deprecated the legacy Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service. This means developers using the older FCM APIs will need to make changes to their infrastructure. To continue sending messages, you’ll need to migrate your custom code to work with the [newer FCM HTTP v1 APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1) or shift to a different solution for sending push notifications. Otherwise, you risk losing the ability to send or receive any push notifications in your apps.

While FCM remains functional under the HTTP v1 API, this change may lead you to consider alternatives. 

# Overview of Firebase Cloud Messaging

FCM, part of Google’s Firebase suite, has been widely used for sending push notifications to Android, iOS, and web applications. It enables developers to engage with users by sending targeted, real-time messages and updates. However, with FCM being deprecated in June 2024, developers must migrate to new FCM HTTP v1 APIs or explore alternative solutions.

## FCM key features:

- **Cross-platform messaging**: Support for Android, iOS, and web apps.
- **Push notifications**: Send notifications to users even when apps are not actively in use.
- **Real-time messaging**: Deliver messages instantly or based on conditions.
- **Topic-based messaging**: Send messages to user groups based on defined topics.
- **Analytics integration**: Track engagement, open rates, and more through Firebase Analytics.

While FCM was a popular choice due to its deep integration with Firebase and Google Cloud services, its reliance on the broader Google ecosystem limited flexibility for some developers, especially those looking for more customizable or privacy-friendly solutions. 

# Messaging: an open-source alternative

Appwrite is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides a suite of tools for managing databases, authentication, storage, serverless functions and, most importantly, messaging. 

Appwrite’s [Messaging](https://appwrite.io/products/messaging) service is built to address the real-time communication needs of modern applications in a fully secure and open-source way. 

## Messaging key features:

- **Cross-platform messaging**: Like FCM, Messaging supports push notifications for Android, iOS, and web platforms, as well as SMS and email.
- **Server-side SDKs**: Provides flexibility for integrating notifications directly into your backend services.
- **Secure and private**: Appwrite is [fully GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA-compliant](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/security), ensuring the secure storage of your and your users’ data.
- **Targeting, scheduling**, **and previewing:** You can draft, preview and schedule your message directly from the console, ensuring you’re targeting the right users at the right time.
- **Integrations:** Appwrite provides a variety of [third-party integrations](https://appwrite.io/integrations#messaging) to up your messaging game.
- **Community and support**: As an open-source platform, Appwrite benefits from a growing developer community and comprehensive documentation.

# Comparing FCM and Appwrite’s Messaging service

## Ease of setup

**FCM:**

Firebase offers an easy-to-use interface that is well-suited for developers already working within the Google ecosystem. FCM integrates smoothly with mobile apps via the Firebase SDK and benefits from the Google Cloud infrastructure. 

**Messaging:**

Appwrite Messaging, part of the broader Appwrite ecosystem, offers a [user-friendly setup](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging). You can develop in the language and framework of your choice, eliminating any vendor lock-in. 

This flexibility means you can integrate messaging into your apps while retaining complete control over your infrastructure and data. Whether you choose to self-host or use a cloud setup, Appwrite empowers you to customize the environment without being tied to a single platform.

## Push notifications

**FCM:**

FCM is tightly integrated with Google's infrastructure, making it the go-to option for Android developers. Its native support in Android allows for easy setup without complex configurations, providing a seamless experience for push notification delivery. Optimized for performance, FCM ensures efficient notifications with minimal impact on battery life and device resources. 

**Messaging:**

While Appwrite Messaging can't fully replace FCM on Android due to Google's native integration, it provides a highly customizable push messaging solution for developers looking to maintain full control over their infrastructure, data, and security.

Additionally, Appwrite supports platforms beyond Android and iOS, making it suitable for broader use cases and custom implementations, particularly for teams looking to self-host or avoid dependency on proprietary cloud services.

## Data privacy and security

**FCM:**

With FCM, data is managed through Google Cloud, which may raise concerns for teams working with sensitive data or those requiring specific compliance with data privacy regulations. Google provides strong security features but operates under its terms and conditions.

**Messaging:**

Appwrite is fully compliant with [GDPR](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-appwrite-is-gdpr-compliant), [CCPA](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-appwrite-is-ccpa-compliant), and [HIPAA](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-appwrite-is-hipaa-compliant) regulations. It also offers encryption and built-in security mechanisms to protect your messaging infrastructure. 

## Pricing

**FCM:**

Firebase offers a generous free tier with FCM, and additional costs are often covered under the broader Firebase service pricing model. However, as your app scales, these costs can add up depending on your use of other Firebase services.

**Messaging:**

Messaging is currently in beta and is free to use for both self-hosted and cloud solutions, but we will release competitive pricing in Q4 of 2024. Keep an eye out on our [pricing page](https://appwrite.io/pricing).

### Developer community and support

**FCM:**

Firebase has the benefit of a large, established community and extensive documentation. 

**Messaging:**

Appwrite maintains an active and growing open-source community. With frequent contributions, updates, and a supportive user base, developers can expect responsive help and continued innovation.

# Migrating from FCM

With the deprecation of FCM in June 2024, developers are faced with the choice of migrating to FCM HTTP v1 API or seeking alternatives like Appwrite. If you’re looking to maintain flexibility and data control in your push notifications, Appwrite’s Messaging service offers a powerful, scalable alternative.

# Conclusion

Firebase Cloud Messaging remains a powerful option, especially within the Google ecosystem.

But in a world where data privacy and control are becoming increasingly important, Appwrite provides an opportunity to build a messaging infrastructure that’s both open and secure.
