We are updating Appwrite’s pricing as part of Appwrite Cloud’s move from beta to General Availability. For an extended period, Appwrite Cloud beta remained free for all users. As of January 2024, we introduced pricing for beta. Today, we are introducing a new base price and an updated pricing model that aligns with developer needs and industry standards. This will include pricing for Appwrite Sites and Messaging.

# Apwrite’s new pricing

This new structure and pricing are designed to be more predictable and better aligned with how teams *actually* use Appwrite. Below is a brief overview of the pricing changes, which we will elaborate on later in this post.

Starting September 1st, 2025, the following pricing changes will go into effect:

- The base price for Pro will go from $15 to $25 per month
- The per-seat pricing model is moving to a per-project pricing model
- Resources will be per project instead of per organization, and we will be giving you more resources per project
- The bandwidth resources on Pro and Scale will increase by +500%, from 300GB to 2TB per month per project
- The additional bandwidth price has decreased by 62%, from $40 per 100GB to $15 per 100GB
- The price for GB hours has decreased by 33%, from $0.09 per GB hour to $0.06 per GB hour
- The additional storage price has decreased by 6.7%, from $3 per 100GB to $2.8 per 100GB
- Appwrite Messaging and Sites now have resource limits on Free, Pro, and Scale plans

# Why are we making these changes

Since launching Appwrite Cloud, we’ve introduced significant improvements that benefit every project in over 900 version releases. These include more global regions, the new Appwrite Edge network, built-in CDN and DDoS protection, and new products like Appwrite Messaging and Appwrite Sites. These have all been included at no additional cost during the beta period.

## More Appwrite, new price

The updated base pricing from $15 to $25 helps us sustainably support this growing feature set and scale our infrastructure. Every paid project will now come with its dedicated pool of resources, giving you better performance, more transparency, and a more apparent connection between what you pay and what you get.

The increased bandwidth, from 300GB to 2TB per project, and the reduced price for additional bandwidth from $40 to $15 per 100GB, significantly impact costs. Where you initially had to pay up to $680 extra to get to the same bandwidth, you now pay $15.

For larger projects, the reduced bandwidth price has an even more significant impact on costs, as this chart shows.

## More products more capabilities

It’s important to mention the release of Appwrite Messaging and Sites. These two products allow you to reduce the number of vendors and ensure you get a complete development platform in one subscription, at no additional cost. With the addition of the Appwrite Network, DDoS, and global CDN, we aim to guarantee excellent global performance for all products.

## Pay per project, not per seat

When we introduced pricing, we did so with a per-seat model. Since then, we have learned a lot. We have received much feedback that this model limits adoption and gets in the way of collaboration. Although having unlimited projects seemed like the right move, it has not been shown to deliver the expected value. Developers are forced to share accounts, making collaboration clunky and even unpleasant.

Talking to developers, one thing became clear: the real value of Appwrite is how fast it helps you go from idea to launch. New projects are where momentum starts, learning happens, and the platform delivers the most impact. We’ve structured the new pricing around this point of highest impact, right where Appwrite delivers the most value.

## Pricing and resource changes

Another important factor we considered is valuing output, not input. This means pricing the resources you use, not the team building with Appwrite. To ensure we always give you the best possible resource price, we have made optimizations that directly affect the price of GB hours, additional storage, and bandwidth.

| **Item** | **Before** | **New** | **$ Change** | **% Change** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base | $15 | $25 | +$10 | +66.67% |
| Per additional member | $15 | $0 | -$15 | -100% |
| Per additional project | $0 | $15 | +$15 | +100% |
| Functions GB hours | $0.18 per GB hour | $0.06 per GB hour | -$0.12 | -66.67% |
| Additional Storage | $3 per 100GB  | $2.8 per 100GB  | -$0.2 | -6.67% |
| Additional bandwidth | $40 per 100GB | $15 per 100GB | -$25 | -62.5% |
| Bandwidth resource per project on Pro and Scale | 300GB | 2TB | -$255* | +566.67% |

*Based on the new additional bandwidth price of $15.

We have created graph overviews to show how costs evolve per project with the new project price and new resource pricing.

*Showing the starting point of $15 and showing the growth rate of pricing based on the new additional resource prices.

This chart shows that each project, even with a $15 starting price per project, will be more cost-effective in the long run due to lower costs for additional resources. Resource prices will become cheaper as we continue to optimize Appwrite.

![More resources](/images/blog/appwrite-pricing-update/bandwidth-project.png)

Previously, you got 300GB bandwidth across all projects. As of the first of September, you will get 2TB of bandwidth per project. This is **6.7× more** free bandwidth per project.

![What you get for 50 dollars](/images/blog/appwrite-pricing-update/add-ons.png)

With $50 add-ons, you now get more compute, storage, and bandwidth.

# Sites and Messaging pricing

Appwrite Sites and Messaging will have the same pricing structure as other Appwrite products. This means that both products will be available on Appwrite’s Free plan with limits that are widened on the paid plans and additional pricing for extra resources.

## Sites resource limits and pricing

To keep things simple, we are not adding separate resource pricing for Sites! Appwrite already has pricing for storage, bandwidth, compute, and function executions. Sites usage will be part of this to ensure your billing is simple and transparent. As we evolve Sites, we only add limits and pricing for features unique to this product.

Below you will find an overview of what is included for Appwrite Sites in the base pricing of the Free, Pro, and Scale plans, and the price for additional resources.

| **Item** | **Free** | **Pro** | **Scale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sites** | 1 per project | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## Messaging resource limits and pricing

Below is an overview of the resources included for Appwrite Messaging in the base pricing of the Free, Pro, and Scale plans and the price for additional resources.

| **Item** | **Free** | **Pro** | **Scale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Messages | 1000 a month | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Topics | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Targets | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| In app notifications | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Chat | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Push notifications | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Email | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| SMS | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Discord | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| WhatsApp | No | Yes | Yes |
| Slack | No | Yes | Yes |
| Analytics | No | Coming soon | Coming soon |
|  |  |  |  |

### What counts as a message?

Each time an end user is sent a message per channel, a message is counted. This means that when you have one end user with three targets (email, SMS, and Push notification) and send all three, this counts as three messages.

# One subscription to replace them all

With the introduction of Messaging and Sites, Appwrite became an all-in-one development platform. Eliminating the need to juggle multiple vendors. With these two products, we drastically improve the developer experience by removing friction between integrating vendors and managing multiple API keys, but most of all, we give you more oversight of your costs. Now you can use one vendor for all your development needs and also see all costs for your backend infrastructure, messaging, and hosting in one place. As mentioned, this is reflected in Appwrite’s base price.

| **Vendor** | **Appwrite** | **Supabase** | **Firebase** | **Vercel** | **Netlify** | **Novu** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BaaS** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Hosting** | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Messaging** | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Open source** | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Monthly base price** | $25 | $25 | Pay as you go | $20 | $19 | $30 |

# Frequently asked questions

## How much more bandwidth do I get per project?

You will get 2TB of bandwidth per project on the paid plans, Pro and Scale. Previously, you got 300GB bandwidth across all projects. If we calculate just for one project, you will have 1700GB more, which is an increase of +566.67%.

## How many seats will I have on paid plans?

On both the Pro and Scale plans, you will have unlimited seats. This is part of the pricing model change, moving from per seat to per project.

## Why the change to per-project vs per-seat?

With the recent features, improvements, and going GA, it’s time to re-align our pricing with the value that Appwrite provides.
Customers experience Appwrite’s value at the project level (Databases, Auth, Storage, etc.), not by individual seats. Charging where we deliver the most value is industry best practice.
We’ve also noticed people share accounts, indicating they don’t find value in paying for the seat.
This change puts Appwrite on a more sustainable revenue model, ensuring longevity and growth for all.

## How much will I pay for my projects after September 1st?

This depends on your situation. It is important to understand whether you are paying for add-ons or not. In this case, you will pay a lot less for your add-ons, and if you’re paying for additional bandwidth, there is a big chance you won’t have to due to the jump from 300GB to 2TB in resources. However, you will be charged $15 for each additional project you have.

Please get in touch with us if you have any questions concerning your projects and the new pricing at billing@appwrite.io.

## How will the per-project pricing affect the Education (GitHub student) plan?

The Education plan will continue to allow multiple projects.

Please remember that the Education plan is only for educational purposes and is not allowed for commercial purposes ([fair use policy](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/platform/fair-use-policy)).
