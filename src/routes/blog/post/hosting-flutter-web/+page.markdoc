Appwrite has long been a powerful backend platform for Flutter developers building mobile applications. Today, we’re bringing that same seamless experience to the web. With full support for Flutter in [Appwrite Sites](/products/sites), you can now deploy Flutter web apps directly from your Appwrite project. No extra configuration, no added complexity.

This means you can use your existing Dart and Flutter knowledge to create fast, responsive web apps without needing to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Build once with Flutter and deploy to mobile, desktop, and web. All from a single codebase, all hosted on Appwrite.

# Why Native Flutter Web Support Matters

While most web environments are made for Node, Deno, or Bun runtimes, only a few are tailored for the needs of Flutter developers. Appwrite Sites is different. It’s designed with full Flutter web support in mind,  not just as an afterthought. That means native framework detection, optimized build settings, and direct integration with your Appwrite backend products like databases, authentication, storage, and functions.

More importantly, it eliminates the common friction points of mobile app deployment. You don’t need to pay for developer accounts ($25 for Android, $99/year for Apple), wait days for store approvals, or navigate restrictive platform policies. With web deployment, your app is live the moment you push it.

And because web apps run anywhere with a browser, you’re no longer limited to iOS or Android. Your Flutter app can be accessed from a desktop, tablet, mobile phone, or even a smart fridge. The web is universal, and Appwrite makes it easy to reach your users.

# Not just for full web apps

Even if you're not targeting the web as your primary platform, Appwrite Sites still solves real needs for Flutter developers.

Many apps include flows that rely on external links, such as email verification, password reset, or payments. These typically direct users to a browser. With Sites, you can now create and host those supporting pages using the same Flutter tooling you're already familiar with.

Instead of stitching together HTML pages or managing another stack, you can build these "satellite" pages as lightweight Flutter web apps,  and deploy them effortlessly with Appwrite. It's a way you leverage your existing knowledge and a more consistent way to build, with fewer moving parts and one unified codebase.

# Key features

- **Full Flutter Framework Support**: Sites now recognizes and supports Flutter as a framework during setup.
- **Auto-Detection**: Flutter web projects are automatically identified.  No manual config required.
- **Optimized Static Hosting**: Deployed like any other static site, but with Flutter-first optimizations.
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatically deploy on every push from your GitHub repository.
- **Works on Cloud and Self-Hosted**: Whether using Appwrite Cloud or Self-hosting, Sites for Flutter works everywhere.

# How to get started

## Step 1: Create Flutter Web app

First, you must either create a Flutter Web app or set up the [Flutter Web starter template](https://github.com/appwrite/templates-for-sites).

Open your terminal, and run the following command.

```bash
flutter create my_app
```

In case you have an existing Flutter app and want to add web support to it, you need to run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
flutter create . --platforms web
```

Push this project to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/new).

## Step2: Create Appwrite project

Head to the [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/).

If this is your first time using Appwrite, create an account and create your first project.

## Step 3: Create site

Head to the **Sites** page in your Appwrite project, click on the **Create site** button, and select **Connect a repository**.

Connect your GitHub account and select the repository you intend to deploy.

1. Select the **production branch** and **root directory** from your repo.
2. Verify that the **correct framework** is selected. In case an incorrect framework is visible, pick **Flutter Web** from the drop-down list.
3. Confirm the **install command**, **build command**, and **output directory** in the build settings. The default build settings for Flutter Web are:
    - **Install command:** `N/A` (leave empty)
    - **Build command:** `flutter build web`
    - **Output directory:** `./build/web`
4. Add any **environment variables** required by the site.

Click on the **Deploy** button.

## Step 4: Visit site

After successful deployment, click on the **Visit site** button.

# Simplifying development

Sites for Flutter is part of Appwrite’s larger mission to simplify the developer experience. With support for backend and frontend services, including static hosting, databases, functions, and auth, Appwrite is the all-in-one platform to build any application.

Try it today on **Appwrite Cloud** or **self-hosted,** and you can take your Flutter app live in just a few clicks.
