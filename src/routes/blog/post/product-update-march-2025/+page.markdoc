# Appwrite MCP server

Did you know that Appwrite has launched its own MCP server? This means you can now let AI agents like Cursor or Windsurf analyze database records, access the User API, or perform actions directly on your Appwrite project.

Not sure where to start? No worries, we’ve got you covered.

- [Learn more about MCP and how it works under the hood](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/what-is-mcp)

The Appwrite MCP server opens up infinite possibilities, and this is just the beginning. We can't wait to see how you’ll use it in your projects.

# Appwrite Cloud backups are now faster

Appwrite Cloud backups are now significantly faster. We’ve made key optimizations to our infrastructure, reducing backup times by up to 7x. With quicker data recovery and improved reliability, you can spend less time waiting and more time building.

# Update to budget limits in Appwrite Cloud

We’ve improved budget limits in Appwrite Cloud to give you better control over your organization’s scaling.

Now, setting the budget to 0 means your organization will not exceed its allocated resources, while null will explicitly disable the budget. This update ensures clearer budget management and better control over scaling.
