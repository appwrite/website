Right after Init, we hit the ground running with a busy month. We introduced the new **Roles** feature, announced **CCPA compliance**, and kicked off the **Appwrite** **Hacktoberfest Hackathon.**

Let’s dive into it!

![New roles announcement](/images/blog/product-update-september/3.png)
# New roles

We’ve introduced Roles, a feature designed to bring granular permissions to the Appwrite Console, available for both the Pro and Scale plans.
Alongside the existing owner role, you can now assign these new roles to your team members:

- Developer
- Editor
- Analyst
- Billing

To celebrate the new feature, you can invite members with the new roles to your Pro teams for free until the end of the year.

![CCPA announcement](/images/blog/product-update-september/2.png)
# CCPA

Appwrite is now fully CCPA-compliant, bringing you even more security and peace of mind when building your apps. 

The [California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) is a landmark data privacy law that enhances consumer rights for residents of California.

# Product updates

## 1.5.11 Security patch

A security issue was discovered in open-runtimes/executor that caused error stack traces to be included in build and execution logs, potentially exposing sensitive information.

For Appwrite Cloud users, we have deployed a security patch and rotated affected keys to prevent misuse, and we've confirmed that there was no exploitation of this issue, so no action is needed on your part.

If you are using a self-hosted Appwrite instance, we strongly recommend upgrading to version 1.5.11 to implement the security patch and prevent any further exposure. This upgrade is straightforward and requires no migrations or additional steps.

[Check out the changelog for more details.](https://appwrite.io/changelog/entry/2024-09-17)


## Updating collection attribute names and sizes

You can now update attribute names and sizes directly from your Cloud Console.

This update provides better flexibility in managing your data models, allowing you to adjust attributes without needing to recreate them or handle complicated migrations.

This is just one in a series of updates we plan to release for Appwrite databases over the next few weeks.
