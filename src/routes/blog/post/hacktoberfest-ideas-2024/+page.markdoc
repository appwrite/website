Appwrite has just announced our very own **Hacktoberfest 2024 Hackathon**, and if we know our community, you're probably buzzing with ideas! Hacktoberfest is the perfect chance to collaborate, build, and showcase your creativity, whether you’re an experienced developer or just getting started. But with so many possibilities, where do you start?

A few months ago, we hosted our own internal hackathon to foster collaboration, spark creativity, and put the new 1.6 features to the test before [their official release](https://appwrite.io/changelog/entry/2024-09-18). The Appwrite team rose to the challenge and delivered some amazing projects.

In this blog, we’ll highlight a few of those projects to inspire your Hacktoberfest 2024 journey!

# How do you come up with a winning project for Hacktoberfest 2024?

Seasoned hackathon contributor Aditya Oberai [shared his 4-step approach](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/the-subtle-art-of-hackathon%20ideation) to help you brainstorm and ideate for any hackathon:

- **Pick a problem you relate to**: Choose a problem that personally impacts you, as emotional connections will keep you motivated and focused throughout the hackathon.
- **Understand the problem's scale**: Research how many others are affected by the problem, increasing the value of your solution.
- **Evaluate potential solutions**: Brainstorm multiple ways to solve the problem and choose the most practical one, avoiding wasted time later on.
- **Choose a self-sustainable solution**: Pick a solution that can run independently without relying on external systems or resources for long-term success.

# Appwrite Hackathon projects

We have 3 projects we'd like to share that demonstrate a variety of ideas and approaches. We hope these examples provide some inspiration as you start thinking about your own Hacktoberfest projects.

# Cord: A new way to do async

![Cord](/images/blog/get-inspired-for-hackathon/3.png)

Cord is a Discord bot designed to help teams be more effective when communicating through async. It comes with a few handy features like timezone and location in bio, automatic starting messages, and standup summaries.

## What problem does it solve?

Even though we've mastered the art of async communication, misunderstandings can still happen. With a global team, it’s not always clear when others are online. That’s where Cord comes in—it provides a simple way to see when your coworkers are available, making communication smoother and more efficient.

## Key features

- **/location:** Display your current location and timezone in your bio
- **/daily**: Write down your progress, and the command will organize it into a daily standup format automatically.
- **/schedule:** Schedule your message at a later time.
- **/start:** This command will notify your team you began your day, displaying local time.

# Final thoughts

What do all these projects have in common? Beyond being built with Appwrite 1.6, they all tackle challenges that our team faces ourselves. Our top advice is simple: create a project that solves your own pain points (or dive into Reddit or Twitter to discover common developer issues). Remember, the sky’s the limit!

If any of these projects have inspired you and sparked an idea for our Hacktoberfest 2024 Hackathon, don’t forget to [register your team and project here](https://apwr.dev/htf24-hackathon) for a chance to win a prize. Happy coding!
