Svelte and SvelteKit have gained traction among developers due to their efficient compilation, minimal runtime overhead, and built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). While deploying Svelte applications is straightforward, choosing a hosting solution that balances affordability, scalability, and developer-friendly features can be a challenge.

[Appwrite Sites](https://appwrite.io/products/sites) provides a streamlined hosting experience tailored for modern web applications, including Svelte and SvelteKit. It offers features designed to enhance performance, security, and team collaboration. This article explores how Appwrite Sites simplifies deployment, integrates with Svelte's capabilities, and compares to other hosting options.

# Why Appwrite Sites is ideal for Svelte and SvelteKit

## 1. Free hosting without limitations

For individual developers and startups, hosting costs can be a significant factor. Appwrite Sites removes this barrier by offering free hosting, allowing you to launch, test, and iterate on projects without upfront expenses. As your application scales, Appwrite provides a seamless path to grow alongside it.

## 2. Optimized for both static and server-side rendering

SvelteKit supports SSR and SSG, making it versatile for various use cases. Appwrite Sites accommodates both approaches, ensuring static sites benefit from fast global caching while SSR applications dynamically generate content when required. This flexibility allows developers to build anything from blogs to complex web applications with real-time content. Additionally, **Appwrite Functions** can add dynamic functionality to SSR applications.

## 3. Speed-enhancing global CDN

Fast load times are crucial for user experience and SEO. Appwrite Sites leverages a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/network/cdn) to cache and serve static assets efficiently, reducing latency and ensuring optimal performance no matter where your users are located.

## 4. Built-in security and DDoS protection

Security is paramount for modern web applications. Appwrite Sites includes [DDoS protection](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/network/ddos), safeguarding applications against attacks by monitoring and mitigating malicious traffic. It also offers **custom domain management** with built-in SSL encryption, ensuring secure connections without additional configuration.

## 5. Preview deployments for smoother collaboration

Every update to your site generates a **deployment preview link**, making it easy to share and review changes before going live. This feature streamlines teamwork, allowing developers and stakeholders to validate updates in a staging environment before final deployment.

## 6. Multiple deployment options

Deploying your Svelte or SvelteKit application with Appwrite Sites is simple and flexible:

- [Git-based deployments](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git): Automatically deploy updates when pushing changes to your main branch.
- **CLI-based deployment**: Deploy manually with a single command:
    
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy site
    ```
    
- **Manual file uploads**: Upload static assets directly via the Appwrite Console.

Appwrite also provides **starter templates** and example projects to help you get up and running quickly with minimal setup.

## 7. Integrated backend services for dynamic applications

Many Svelte applications require authentication, databases, and cloud functions. Appwrite Sites natively integrates with **Appwrite Auth**, **Appwrite Databases**, and **Appwrite Functions**, eliminating the need for external backend services and simplifying development.
