# Why Appwrite Cloud?
At Appwrite, we are committed to the open-source community and believe that developers should have access to powerful tools and services that are intuitive, developer-centric and affordable. With Appwrite Cloud, we are extending our commitment to provide developers with the best possible experience by offering a fully managed backend solution that simplifies infrastructure management and helps them focus on what they do best - building great applications!

# What was the private beta?
Over the last couple of months, we conducted a successful private beta that allowed us to get Appwrite Cloud in the hands of selected members of the community. This exercise allowed us to learn a lot about usage patterns, infrastructure performance, early feedback and lots more.

We conducted cloud interviews with members of the initial cohort to understand their use cases and identify the most important features for them. These conversations have been invaluable in shaping the direction of Appwrite Cloud, allowing us to prioritize features and improvements.

We also conducted a pricing survey with participants to better understand developer demographics, their needs, their budgets and expectations. This information was instrumental in helping us fine-tune our pricing strategy and deliver the best value for our developers.

# What's new in the public beta?
With the launch of the public beta, we're opening up access to the Appwrite Cloud to a broader audience, allowing more developers to explore and test our platform. The public beta retains all the features and benefits of the private beta while incorporating valuable feedback from our early adopters.

Additionally, we'll continue working closely with the Appwrite community to refine the platform and introduce new features based on user feedback. We also encourage you to join our Discord community where you can get help with anything Appwrite related!

# What’s next?
We have a lot of things planned in the upcoming months while we await Cloud to become publicly available, and we’d love to share some highlights with you.

## Cloud interviews and surveys
We’re conducting a series of interviews & surveys with participants of the Public Beta to get more insights into their requirements. During these interviews, we focus on understanding their background, their reasons for using a backend server like Appwrite, their use cases, their experience so far, along with their expectations and shortcomings of the platform. These interviews have provided key insights that have prompted us to steer in the right direction.

If you’re part of the Beta and would like to participate in these interviews, please reach out to me on the Appwrite Discord or my email, and we’d be glad to set up a call.

## Pricing
Our goal is to make Appwrite Cloud affordable and accessible to all developers. We’ve had some really great feedback from our initial pricing survey and are really close to sharing our model with you all. We will continue working together with the Appwrite community to refine this pricing model. Rest assured, there will be a generous free tier for all the hobby projects you’ve been wanting to create!

## Self-hosted edition
A lot of us may have questions about the open source version of Appwrite and its future. We can proudly say, we will continue to stand among the handful of companies that have been open-source first. Our vibrant community is a testament that, for the longest time, we have prioritized the open source version, and we will continue to do so. In fact, all major features will roll out to the open source version even before they hit the cloud! Appwrite will forever remain open source!

## Multi-region support
During the Beta, we’re operating with Frankfurt as our primary region. This is a careful decision to ensure we are geographically centrally located. As we get closer to general availability, we will focus on 3 more regions, namely San Francisco, New York, and Singapore with more regions to follow.

## Compliance
Compliances are frameworks that help organizations ensure they are meeting certain standards and requirements in regard to data security and privacy. For most SaaS/BaaS companies, SOC 2, HIPAA & GDPR are the essential ones. These certifications help companies demonstrate to their customers and stakeholders they are taking data security and privacy seriously, and are committed to protecting their sensitive information.

These usually involve a lot of paperwork, documentation, and administrative processes. We’re in the process of ensuring we meet the highest standards for data security and privacy.

## Support for more function runtimes
While in beta, Appwrite Cloud supports five serverless runtimes, namely, Node, Python, PHP, Ruby, and Dart. As we approach general availability, we will continue to add support for our entire suite of runtimes based on the requests and requirements of the beta participants.

# Coming up
We’ve set multiple goals and key performance indicators to help us determine the success of this important stage before making the Appwrite Cloud generally available. Those indicators include the feedback and insights we get from beta participants, consumption metrics, and our infrastructure resilience during this time. Once those are achieved, we'll officially announce the release of the Appwrite Cloud platform and reach general availability.

As always, huge thanks to the Appwrite community for your unwavering support. This milestone would not have been possible without your contributions. You're all incredible, and we'll continue working hard to deliver the development platform you deserve.
