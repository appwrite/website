We are excited to announce the launch of Appwrite’s public roadmap on GitHub. The new roadmap is part of our commitment to the Appwrite community and our core values of transparency and collaboration. It was one of the most highly requested features by the Appwrite community and will serve as a tool for increased collaboration among the core team, contributors, maintainers, and Appwrite developers.

By making our development plans public, we aim to provide our community with better visibility into our priorities, streamline the process for reporting bugs and requesting features, and align expectations around platform release timelines.

# Why a public roadmap?

## Increasing transparency
Open communication with the community is crucial for building trust and fostering a collaborative environment. Our public roadmap will show what we are working on, what we plan to tackle next, what features or fixes are on the horizon, and what their release timelines might look like.

## Prioritizing community needs
The community is the heart of Appwrite, and your feedback plays a significant role in shaping our development path. The public roadmap lets you directly influence our priorities by highlighting the most critical bugs and requested features. This guarantees that we focus on the areas that matter most to you. The Appwrite community really is the secret sauce that ensures that the Appwrite project always moves in the right direction.

## Aligning expectations
We understand that knowing when new features and fixes will be available is important for planning and integrating Appwrite into your products. The public roadmap provides clear timelines and updates on our progress, helping you better plan your development cycles, communicate them to your stakeholders, and set expectations accordingly.

# How to use the roadmap

## Accessing the roadmap
You can access our [public roadmap on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/appwrite/projects). The roadmap is organized into different projects for each release, with issues or pull requests assigned to specific versions to indicate when we plan to complete the changes. For example, you can check out the changes planned for version 1.5.8 to see what’s coming up next.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features
To report a bug or request a new feature, simply create an issue on our GitHub repository. When submitting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce bugs and the specific needs for feature requests. This information helps our team to understand and prioritize the issue effectively.

## Engaging with the community
The public roadmap is not just a tool for visibility but also a platform for collaboration. You can comment on existing issues, provide additional context, and even contribute to discussions around feature development. By upvoting bugs or features requests on GitHub you help us prioritize between the different issues and pull requests. Your insights and contributions are invaluable in helping us build a better Appwrite.

## Staying updated
We encourage you to check the public roadmap regularly to stay updated on our progress. You can also watch the repository to receive notifications about new issues, updates, and releases. This way, you will always be in the loop about what’s happening with Appwrite.

## Flexibility and future planning
While the new roadmap offers much more flexibility and visibility into our short-term and mid-term plans, it might still miss some bigger, longer-term projects or milestones that are in the early planning stages or going through an internal or external RFC (Request for Comments) process. These initiatives require more detailed planning and consultation before they can be added to the public roadmap.

# The roadmap framework
To ensure our focus is always on the right areas, we have developed an internal framework to guide our roadmap decisions. This framework is based on the significance of our focus areas, allowing us to set clear priorities, measure progress, understand the impact, maintain balance, and foster collaboration within the team and the Appwrite community.

By concentrating on specific aspects, we ensure our team stays aligned and works towards common goals that reflect our mission while continually improving the overall developer experience. Our roadmap framework revolves around four main pillars:

1. **Friction**: Make it easier for developers to adopt and succeed with Appwrite by streamlining our processes and improving the overall developer experience.
2. **Reliability**: Ensure Appwrite is a reliable, scalable, high-performing solution for all users.
3. **Growth**: Expand Appwrite’s product offerings, enabling more growth-led activities and catering to a broader range of use cases.
4. **Revenue**: Ensure the long-term success and sustainability of Appwrite. Business success is crucial for a better platform and ecosystem for the entire Appwrite community.

These four focus areas help us prioritize, make decisions, and ensure we move toward a better future for Appwrite and the Appwrite community.

# This is a journey
We look forward to taking this step towards greater transparency and collaboration, and we invite you to join us on this journey. Your feedback, ideas, and participation are crucial in making Appwrite the best it can be. Together, we can build a more robust, reliable, and feature-rich platform. The platform developers deserve to have.

Thank you for being a part of the Appwrite community. We look forward to your contributions and continued support.
