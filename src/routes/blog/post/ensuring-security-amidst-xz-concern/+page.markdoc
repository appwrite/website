In the light of recent unsettling revelations regarding a backdoor discovered in the widely-used XZ Utils,
a compression tool used in Linux environments, including Red Hat and Debian systems, the cyber-security landscape has been abuzz with concern.
This discovery had a large potential impact on encrypted SSH connections, a backbone of secure communications in the tech world.

At Appwrite, ensuring the security and trust of our developers and users is paramount.
We understand the concerns that arise from such vulnerabilities and their potential implications.

It's crucial for the Appwrite community to know that Appwrite's services **remain unaffected** by the XZ Utils backdoor.
This issue affected beta and test versions of Red Hat and Debian distributions, which Appwrite **does not use**.

# What does this mean for self-hosting Appwrite?

For our valued users who prefer the self-hosted route, leveraging Appwrite on affected operating systems (OS),
we understand your concerns. Here are our recommendations to ensure your self-hosted Appwrite instances remain secure:

- Immediate Update/Removal: The first and foremost step is to check if you have the affect versions (`5.6.0`,` 5.6.1`) of the XZ Utils installed. If so, downgrade to a safe version or remove the utility altogether.
- Enhanced Monitoring: Keep a keen eye on network traffic and system logs for any unusual activity.
- Employ Firewalls: Employ stringent firewall rules to limit inbound and outbound connections to the bare minimum required for your operations. This reduces the attack surface significantly.
- Regular System Audits: Conduct thorough audits of your systems to ensure no unauthorized modifications have been made to the OS or installed utilities.
- Stay Informed: Follow updates from your OS's security advisory to apply security patches as soon as they are released.

# Does this affect Appwrite Cloud developers?

Appwrite Cloud users can rest assured that our cloud infrastructure is secure and unaffected by the XZ Utils backdoor.
The Appwrite team has taken necessary measures to ensure that containers in our cloud environment do not have the affected versions of the XZ Utils installed.
We also took further steps to restrict SSH access to our cloud infrastructure to reduce attack surfaces further.
No actions are required from Appwrite Cloud developers at this time.

In a world where cyber threats are evolving at an alarming pace,
the Appwrite team is committed to ensuring the security and reliability of Appwrite Cloud's infrastructure,
so you can build applications with peace of mind.
The team will continue to monitor the situation closely, take necessary actions to mitigate any potential risks,
and communicate any updates transparently to the community.
