We're introducing a new way to populate your Appwrite databases: **document imports from CSV files**.

Built on top of Appwrite's migration APIs, this feature makes it easy to bring in large datasets, seed collections, or migrate structured data using only a CSV file.

The CSV document import is useful for migrating user data from external systems, importing inventory records, seeding test environments, or onboarding structured content such as FAQs.

# How it works

To get started, create a collection and define its attributes in the Appwrite Console. Your CSV file should follow a standard format:

- The first row must be a header containing attribute names that match your collection
- Each subsequent row represents a document, with values separated by commas

{% info title="Good to know" %}
You can optionally include the `$id` column to assign custom document IDs.
{% /info %}

All required attributes must be present in the CSV, and Appwrite will validate each row before importing it.

For example, if your collection contains attributes like `title`, `author`, `year`, and `available`, a valid CSV file would look like this:

```text
$id,title,author,year,available
f3k91x8b2q,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,J.K. Rowling,1997,true
mz7lq3dp5c,The Fellowship of the Ring,J.R.R. Tolkien,1954,true
x0v4p8ncq2,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee,1960,false
kq9nmv13ru,The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,1925,true
p8lw39xsd1,Catch-22,Joseph Heller,1961,true
v42cj0quxp,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,1813,true
```

## Uploading your CSV file

You can upload a new file during import or select an existing one from your project's storage bucket.
The Console provides a guided interface to help you select the CSV and link it to your target collection. Once uploaded, the import process begins immediately.

## Designed for scale

CSV imports are built to scale seamlessly with your data. Whether you're working with a small dataset or importing production-grade records, the system is designed to handle high volumes reliably and efficiently.

The import system performs per-row validation and runs as a background task, allowing it to handle large files efficiently. This ensures reliable performance across a range of scenarios—from lightweight configuration data to large-scale production imports.

## Automate with API and SDKs

You can also trigger imports using the Appwrite API or SDKs. This is useful for scripted workflows, automated CI/CD pipelines, or admin dashboards.

All you need is a CSV file in your project's storage and the target collection ID. The rest is handled by Appwrite's import system.


## Availability and resources

CSV imports are now available on **Appwrite Cloud** and in the latest self-hosted release.

If you have any questions or feedback, we'd love to hear from you in the [Appwrite Discord community](https://discord.gg/appwrite).
