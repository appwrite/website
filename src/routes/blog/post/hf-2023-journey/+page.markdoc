**October** is our favorite month of the year because it brings with it **Hacktoberfest**, the largest celebration of open source in the world! And this year, we returned to support DigitalOcean and  **Hacktoberfest 2023** as a sponsor to invest in the upliftment of the open-source world and to rejoice the 10th anniversary of this wonderful initiative. Hacktoberfest brought moments of nostalgia seeing developers from different walks of life join in to take their first steps in the open-source world.

We had an absolute blast interacting with all the new contributors and hosting all the events throughout the month! Our **[Discord server](https://appwrite.io/discord)** was full of **AMAs** and **PR Review parties**, which enabled us to demonstrate our PR review workflow and allowed the community to really appreciate the work that goes into maintaining open-source projects. We were also able to educate new contributors on various facets of open source, usage of tools like Git and GitHub, the process of submitting a PR, communication best practices, and so much more!

Not only did we see multiple virtual events, but we also hosted an [in-person Hacktoberfest Kickoff meetup](https://photos.app.goo.gl/n5YQjK56CCgqyrj68) in collaboration with DigitalOcean in Bengaluru, India. Overall, this Hacktoberfest was one of the most wholesome and fulfilling experiences for our team, and we cannot wait to share our highlights from this edition.

## Our history with Hacktoberfest

Before we jump into some amazing open-source contributions from Hacktoberfest this year, we would love to share why our participation in Hacktoberfest matters far more to us than we can express. **Appwrite was first released back in September 2019** with one mission, to make software development accessible and enjoyable for all. **Hacktoberfest 2019** was truly a game-changer for us, as we saw **over 200 contributions** from some lovely members of the open-source fraternity that October. The stars on our project doubled that month and entered the 4-digit range for the very first time.

That one month truly enabled us to lay the foundations of a budding organization with the sole purpose of helping developers build faster and better. And for that, no thank-yous will ever be enough to express our gratitude for this amazing open source community that chose to carry us on their shoulders at our inception. This year, as a sponsor of Hacktoberfest, we set out with the mission to **uplift the ever-growing open-source community** and **enable more newcomers** to step in and grow in this ecosystem.
