The React world has a new favourite, and developers can’t stop talking about it. [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) is quickly becoming the go-to framework for teams that want simplicity, type safety, control, and performance without the overhead. Built by the same team behind TanStack Query(React Query) and TanStack Router, it’s redefining how React apps are built and shipped: lighter, faster, and closer to how you want to code.

And we know it’s not just another hype, when the creator of jQuery, [John Resig](https://x.com/jeresig), who helped shape modern JavaScript, [calls it *A+*](https://x.com/jeresig/status/1982046991132889191). Then you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Today, we’re excited to announce that **Appwrite Sites now supports TanStack Start**, bringing **full server-side rendering (SSR)** capabilities directly to Appwrite Cloud. Developers can now build and deploy TanStack Start sites with zero configuration.

# Why TanStack Start is in the spotlight

TanStack Start is getting attention because it takes React back to what developers loved about it: simplicity and control. While frameworks like Next.js have grown powerful, they’ve also grown complex. TanStack Start moves in the opposite direction: it feels familiar, predictable, and transparent.

Instead of hiding logic behind conventions or “magic,” it gives you explicit control over routing, data loading, and rendering. 

Everything is type-safe and visible. It blends client-side interactivity with server-side rendering and is powered by Vite for fast builds.

In short, it’s React the way it should be, a framework that’s fast, typed, and built for developers who care about how things actually work.

# TanStack Start support in Appwrite Sites

With TanStack Start support now live in Appwrite Sites, developers can finally run server-side rendering (SSR) natively on Appwrite Cloud.

Before this update, TanStack Start developers often had to deploy their projects as static sites under “other” frameworks, losing the SSR capabilities that make TanStack Start powerful. Others had to look for external platforms to get full functionality, adding unnecessary steps and complexity.

Now, everything works right out of the box. You can build, test, and deploy your TanStack Start projects directly on Appwrite, with full server-side support and zero compromises. It’s a smoother experience that keeps all your logic, hosting, and backend under one open-source stack. Exactly how it should be.

# Immediate benefits

This update means TanStack Start developers can finally go all-in on Appwrite Sites without giving up flexibility or server power. You get the full experience of TanStack’s SSR model, directly on Appwrite Cloud, with seamless setup and deployment.

Here’s what this unlocks:

- **Full SSR support:** TanStack Start apps, now running natively on Appwrite Cloud.
- **First SSR framework for Solid:** Since TanStack Start also supports Solid, Appwrite now extends SSR hosting to additional JavaScript ecosystems like Solid.
or is that redundant
- **All-in-one setup:** Host your frontend, backend, and database in one place, without third-party dependencies.
- **Open-source foundation:** TanStack Start is built on open, familiar web technologies. Nothing proprietary or platform-specific. Next.js works best on Vercel, where all its features are deeply integrated, but running it elsewhere often adds complexity. TanStack Start takes a different approach. Its open architecture means your apps work the same everywhere

The best part? **TanStack Start and Appwrite fit together naturally.** TanStack covers both the frontend and backend logic. It just needs a platform to run on. **Appwrite is that platform.** With built-in services like databases, authentication, and APIs, Appwrite gives TanStack everything it needs to run end-to-end.

# Wrapping up

Supporting TanStack Start is more than just adding another framework. It’s about giving developers the freedom to build the way they want. Since Appwrite owns its entire stack, we’re able to move fast, adapt quickly, and bring modern frameworks to Appwrite Sites without waiting on anyone else.

TanStack Start support is now available on Appwrite Cloud.

Whether you’re a React developer looking for a Next.js alternative, a Solid developer exploring SSR, or just someone who wants modern web tooling without platform lock-in, Appwrite Sites with TanStack Start gives you the flexibility, performance, and control to build your way.
