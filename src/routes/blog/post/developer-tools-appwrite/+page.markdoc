Any developer-focused product is only as good as the ecosystem of developer tools surrounding it. Fortunately, over the years, we have seen several outstanding tools developed by our community, as well as a few we have developed in-house to make development with Appwrite far more productive.

# Our favourite developer tools for Appwrite

## ngx-appwrite

ngx-appwrite is a library designed to integrate Appwrite services seamlessly into Angular 16+ applications. It acts as a wrapper around the Appwrite Web SDK, simplifying the use of Appwrite's features within Angular projects. The library enhances developer productivity by providing RxJS streams, which facilitate reactive programming patterns commonly used in Angular applications. This integration allows developers to easily implement Appwrite's backend services, such as database, authentication, and storage while leveraging Angular's powerful framework for building dynamic web applications.
