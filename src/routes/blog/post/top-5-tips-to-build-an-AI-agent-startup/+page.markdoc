With AI advancing at a rapid pace, 2025 is shaping up to be the year of AI agents. We're moving beyond basic chatbots and entering a new era where AI can autonomously solve complex tasks. So, in the near future, fully autonomous AI agents can scope out a project and complete it with all the necessary tools they need and with no help from human partners.

They are evolving from just content generators to autonomous problem-solvers. This shift opens up massive opportunities for founders to build AI agents that have the ability to reason, to use tools and perform complex tasks.
In this blog, we'll explain what AI agents are and give tips on how you can build a successful AI agent startup.

# What are AI agents?

AI agents refer to programs or systems that use AI to perform specific tasks without human intervention. They can reason, plan, and have a memory, which shows some level of autonomy.

The best part is that, unlike traditional AI workflows, which follow a fixed and pre-defined path where you have to outline every step explicitly, AI agents show autonomy in decision-making and execution. This means you just have to assign a task, and it's the AI agent's job to determine how many steps it needs to take and how it will approach the task to get the job done.

For example, AI coding agents can autonomously make changes to code, run tests, and iterate on the solutions until the code is optimized. The agent doesn't know beforehand how many iterations or changes it needs to make. It's just focused on getting the best outcome.

# Applications of AI agents

We can already see early glimpses of AI agents performing simple tasks like analyzing data, predicting trends, and automating workflows to some extent. However, for more sophisticated use cases, the technology has yet to mature. Here are a few applications of AI agents:

## Customer support

AI agents can handle customer queries and iterate through questions and solutions until they resolve the customer's issue.

Example: An AI agent interacts with a customer to troubleshoot an issue and also ask additional questions if needed.

## Coding and software development

AI agents can help developers to write, modify, and test code. They can also run unit tests and iteratively improve the code until it passes.

Example: A coding agent could identify bugs, suggest fixes, and run the relevant tests, all autonomously.

## Automating repetitive tasks

Small tasks that are repetitive but important, such as processing data or categorizing documents, can be automated using AI agents.

Example: An agent automates the process of categorizing emails or managing small, recurring administrative tasks.

## Multi-Agent systems

Advanced applications where multiple agents can collaborate and interact with each other to complete more complex tasks.

Example: Multiple AI agents can analyze vast amounts of financial data, providing insights and recommendations.

# Tips for building an AI agent startup

With the current pace of AI advancements, where we now have better, faster and smaller models, as compared to the past 15-18 months, the stage is set for the next wave of AI agent development. Many large companies and startups are already experimenting with AI agents, and in the near future, AI agents will soon be everywhere, impacting industries in new and exciting ways.

This is the perfect time to dive into building an AI agent startup. So, here are some essential tips to help you get started.

## Define the Agent's Autonomy

Agents should have the ability to decide how many actions or steps they need to take to reach a resolution, rather than following a rigid, pre-defined sequence.

Make sure your agent can loop through multiple steps, figuring out when to stop or go back to earlier stages until it finds the right solution. This flexibility allows it to handle more complex tasks on its own.

## Empathize with the model's limitations

AI models often lack the broader context that humans naturally bring to a task. When building agents, try to understand things from the model's point of view. Think about what information or context it might be missing to perform well.

This will guide your prompt design and ensure that the agent has enough clarity to make decisions and complete tasks effectively.

## Start simple and scale gradually

When building agents, start with simple tasks or single-action models and gradually increase complexity. This lets you fine-tune each stage and make sure it works well before you add more complexity.

In the beginning, keep it simple, measure performance, and adjust the agent's behavior as needed before scaling up.

## Ensure Feedback Mechanisms

Incorporating feedback loops is essential for refining an agent's performance. In particular, coding agents can greatly benefit from feedback through tests that verify the correctness of their output.

Set up systems where agents can learn from their results and keep improving until they get it right.

## Measure and Monitor Results

Building agents without a way to measure their effectiveness can be risky. Before fully developing an agent, create clear metrics to evaluate its performance. For example, in coding agents, metrics could include test results, response times, or successful iterations.

Having clear measurements ensures you can monitor progress, spot any issues, and fine-tune the agent as it evolves.

# Conclusion

AI agents are changing the way businesses operate, and the timing couldn't be better for founders looking to tap into this space. Look for workflows or repetitive tasks that can be automated by AI agents. Start with simple tasks and then gradually increase the complexity.
