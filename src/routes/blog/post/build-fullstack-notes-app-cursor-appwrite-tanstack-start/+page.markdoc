Developers are entering a new era where AI can *understand context and build with you*.  
AI-powered editors like **Cursor** blur the line between development and automation, while **Appwrite** provides the unified backend that turns those AI-generated ideas into production-ready applications.

Together, they represent the next leap forward, where AI helps you go from idea → API → local app in minutes.

I chose to use Cursor as it's my *favorite* coding agent. We all have our favorite, and I'll definitely keep building with Cursor as it's just more user friendly.

In this tutorial, you’ll:

- Connect Cursor to Appwrite using **MCP**
- Build a **TanStack Start** app with authentication and CRUD
- Run it locally
- Deploy it anywhere later (Appwrite Sites, Netlify, Vercel, etc)

# What Is MCP and Why It Matters

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** lets AI tools like Cursor securely connect to APIs and databases.  
The **Appwrite MCP server** gives Cursor access to your Appwrite project so it can create collections, write code, and query real data.

👉 [**Add Appwrite MCP to Cursor**](https://appwrite.io/docs/tooling/mcp/cursor)

---

# Setting up the Appwrite MCP Server

## 1. Create an API Key in Appwrite Cloud
* Log in to [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io).
* Create a **new API key** with **all scopes** (for setup) or select specified scopes.
* Copy the key.

## 2. Copy your Project ID
Go to **Project → Overview**, hover over **Project ID**, and copy it.

## 3. Add the MCP Server in Cursor
In Cursor → **Tools → Installed MCP Servers → Add Custom MCP**:

![Cursor MCP Settings](/images/blog/build-fullstack-notes-app-cursor-appwrite-tanstack-start/cursor-mcp-settings.PNG)

You can specify specific routes instead of choosing --all, such as --databases, --users, --functions since having too many may degrade performance in Cursor.

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Name | `appwrite` |
| Command | `uvx mcp-server-appwrite --all` |
| APPWRITE_ENDPOINT | `https://[REGION].cloud.appwrite.io/v1` |
| APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID | `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` |
| APPWRITE_API_KEY | `<YOUR_API_KEY>` |

Make sure you update your region, project ID, and API key, which is all found in your Appwrite Console.

Click **Install**, then verify it appears in your MCP list.

---

# Troubleshooting MCP

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `uvx not recognized` | Install **uv**:<br>Windows → `irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex`<br>macOS/Linux → `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` |
| Only “users” endpoint visible | Use `--all` flag or add endpoints manually in config |
| MCP not found | Open a **new Cursor conversation** or restart Cursor |

# Building the Notes App

> No external API keys needed — fully local CRUD app with Appwrite.

![TanStack Notes App](/images/blog/build-fullstack-notes-app-cursor-appwrite-tanstack-start/tanstacknotesapp.PNG)

---

# Create a Project Folder

```bash
mkdir ai-notes && cd ai-notes
cursor .
```

---

# Remove Scaffolded Docs + Create Routes

> **Note:** TanStack Start scaffolds a demo/docs route. You'll replace it with real app routes.

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Remove any TanStack Start demo/docs routes. Replace them with:
- / → Landing page (redirects to /notes if logged in, else /login)
- /login → Login page
- /signup → Signup page
- /notes → Notes app (protected, requires login)
Ensure "/" never shows the TanStack Start docs page.
```

---

# Scaffold TanStack Start (SSR)

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Create a TanStack Start project named "ai-notes" with TypeScript and SSR. 
Set up a clean src structure with routes, components, and lib folders.
```

**Commands:**
```bash
npm create tanstack@latest
Choose: Start (SSR), TypeScript
npm i
```

> 💡 Cursor may prompt: `npm install --save-dev tsx` — that’s expected for SSR dev mode.

---

# Create `.env.local` from MCP

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Create a .env.local file and populate:
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT and VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID
Use values from my connected Appwrite MCP server (use regional endpoint with /v1).
```

**Example:**
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://nyc.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

Restart `npm run dev` after editing `.env.local`.

---

# Configure the Appwrite SDK

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Install the Appwrite Web SDK as a normal dependency (not dev).
Create a client helper that reads from VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT and VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID.
```

**Commands:**
```bash
npm i appwrite
```

**Helper:**
```ts
// src/lib/appwrite.ts
import { Client, Account, Databases, ID } from 'appwrite';

const client = new Client()
  .setEndpoint(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT!)
  .setProject(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID!);

export const account = new Account(client);
export const databases = new Databases(client);
export { ID };
```

---

# Create Database & Collection via MCP

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Using the Appwrite MCP server, create a database "main" and a collection "notes" with fields:
title, content, userId, createdAt, updatedAt.
Grant authenticated user read/write and save IDs to src/lib/config.ts.
```

---

# Add Authentication (session-safe, no auto-login)

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Create an auth helper with session-safe login/logout:

Requirements:
- login(email, password):
  1. Check if a session exists; if yes, delete all sessions first.
  2. Create a new email/password session.
  3. If "session already active" error occurs, delete all sessions and retry once.
  4. Return the current user via account.get().

- logout(): delete all sessions.

- getCurrentUser(): return account.get(); if unauthenticated, return null.

Update the /login page:
- NEVER auto-redirect away from /login. Always show the form so users can switch accounts.
- On successful login, navigate to /notes.
- Show clear errors if something fails.

Update route guards:
- /notes loader/server check: if no session, redirect to /login.
- / index loader/server check: if session → /notes, else → /login.
```

**Helper (`src/lib/auth.ts`):**
```ts
import { Account, Client, ID } from 'appwrite';

const client = new Client()
  .setEndpoint(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT!)
  .setProject(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID!);

const account = new Account(client);

export async function getCurrentUser() {
  try {
    return await account.get();
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
}

export async function deleteAllSessions() {
  try {
    await account.deleteSessions();
  } catch {
    // ignore; we might not have a session
  }
}

export async function login(email: string, password: string) {
  await deleteAllSessions();

  try {
    await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
  } catch (err: any) {
    const msg = err?.message?.toLowerCase?.() ?? '';
    if (msg.includes('session') && msg.includes('active')) {
      await deleteAllSessions();
      await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
    } else {
      throw err;
    }
  }

  return await account.get();
}

export async function signup(email: string, password: string, name?: string) {
  await account.create(ID.unique(), email, password, name);
  return await login(email, password);
}

export async function logout() {
  await deleteAllSessions();
}
```

# Add CRUD for Notes

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Create a /notes route that lists, creates, updates, and deletes notes using Appwrite Databases API.
Include loading, error, and empty states.
```

---

# Style and Quality Pass (Tailwind v4, Accessibility)

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Add Tailwind CSS v4 and basic styling. 
Fix any invalid utilities like focus-visible:ring-opacity-* or custom @apply utilities.
Add accessible focus styles (focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-blue-500/100).
```

---

# Run Locally

**Prompt (Cursor):**
```text
Ensure npm scripts for dev, build, and preview exist.
Run npm run dev first, then npm run build && npm run preview to verify before deployment.
```

**Commands:**
```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

✅ **Verify routes:**
- `/` → redirects to `/notes` if logged in, `/login` if not  
- `/login` + `/signup` → show correct forms  
- `/notes` → works only when logged in  
- No TanStack Start docs page appears

---

# Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `/` shows TanStack docs page | Delete demo/docs routes and create `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/notes` manually. |
| `focus-visible-ring` or `ring-opacity-*` errors | Tailwind v4 removed those utilities — use color/alpha rings instead. |
| Missing `.env` file | Create `.env.local` using values from Appwrite MCP. |
| 401/403 errors | Verify API key scopes + collection permissions. |
| "Creation of a session is prohibited when a session is active." | Use session-safe login flow. Delete all sessions first, retry once if needed, and remove auto-login logic from `/login`. |
