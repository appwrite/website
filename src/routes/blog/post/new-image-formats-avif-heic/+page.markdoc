We’re excited to share we have added support for two new image formats in Appwrite Storage: **HEIC** and **AVIF.** This will give you more tools to manage, manipulate, and serve images the way you need.

You can generate image previews directly in **.heic** and **.avif** formats, which are natively supported in Appwrite.

No converters. No extra steps. Just fast, flexible image handling built in.

# Native support for next-gen formats

Image performance matters. Whether you're building a high-performance photo app or just optimizing media delivery, modern formats like AVIF and HEIC offer massive benefits: smaller sizes, better quality, and native platform support.

With this update, Appwrite now supports outputting previews in **HEIC** (Apple’s proprietary format) and **AVIF** (a modern open format with excellent compression).

# Why it matters

Previously, if you wanted to serve HEIC or AVIF images from Appwrite, you had to download them, convert them manually, and re-upload or host elsewhere.

Now, the Appwrite Storage preview API can do it all automatically.

This means:

- No more external tools
- No extra conversion steps
- No breaking your image pipeline

Just fast, reliable image delivery in the formats you need.

# Built for Apple and beyond

HEIC is Apple’s default image format on iOS. AVIF is increasingly used across modern browsers and devices.

This feature was designed for mobile app developers, especially those targeting iOS and working with native image capture and display. But it’s just as useful for any developer looking to serve modern image formats with better compression and quality.

# How to use it

Use the image preview endpoint as you normally would, just set the desired output format to HEIC or AVIF. It works the same way as existing format conversions like `jpg` or `png`.

You’ll see smaller file sizes, faster load times, and better integration with native apps and devices.

# How to get started

HEIC and AVIF support is available on **Appwrite Cloud** and **self-hosted** installations.

```jsx
import { Client, Storage, ImageFormat } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const storage = new Storage(client);

const resultHeic = storage.getFilePreview({
    bucketId: 'photos',
    fileId: 'sunset.png',
    width: 1800,
    gravity: 'center',
    quality: '90',
    borderWidth: 5,
    borderColor: 'CDCA30',
    borderRadius: 15,
    background: 'FFFFFF',
    output: ImageFormat.Heic
});
console.log(resultHeic.href);

const resultAvif = storage.getFilePreview({
  bucketId: 'photos',
  fileId: 'sunset.jpeg',
  output: ImageFormat.Avif
})
console.log(resultAvif.href);
```

# Smarter storage for better apps

This feature is part of our ongoing commitment to giving you modern tools that work the way you expect. Whether you're building a media-heavy app, targeting Apple platforms, or just caring about performance, you now have more control and better output without extra overhead.
