Ever downloaded an app, used it once, and then completely forgot about it? You’re not alone; most users churn within days if they don’t see immediate value. That’s where push notifications come in. Done right, they’re not just those little pop-ups that interrupt your screen but can be powerful nudges that can bring users back, guide them through the product, and even turn casual sign-ups into loyal advocates.

In this guide, we’ll explain everything you need to know about push notifications, highlight best practices, and show you how Appwrite makes it simple for developers to set up reliable, personalized notifications.

# tl;dr

[Push notifications](/docs/products/messaging) help re-engage users when timed and personalized well. With Appwrite, you can send mobile and web notifications through [Apple Push Notification service(APNs)](/docs/products/messaging/apns) or [Firebase Cloud Messaging(FCM)](/docs/products/messaging/fcm), target users by topics or IDs, and set it all up in just four steps.

# How push notifications work (and why they matter)

Push notifications are simple: your app sends a small message to a device through a provider’s service (like APNs for iOS or FCM for Android), and that message shows up instantly on the user’s screen. The real value is in the timing and relevance. Notifications are the bridge between your product and a user who might otherwise forget you exist.

Why they matter is straightforward: retention. Most apps lose the majority of users within the first few days. [Push notifications](/docs/products/messaging/send-push-notifications), when done right, are a gentle way to bring them back, remind them of value, or nudge them toward the next step in their journey.

# 4 strategies to keep users engaged

1. Personalize the message

A generic “Come back!” rarely works. Tie your notification to user behaviour: “Your order is on the way” or “You left something in your cart.” When the message feels relevant, users are far more likely to engage.
    
2. Respect frequency
    
The quickest way to lose trust is to overdo it. Daily blasts might seem like engagement, but they often lead to uninstalls. A thoughtful cadence, only when the message adds real value, keeps users interested without pushing them away.
    
3. Use timing to your advantage
    
Notifications land best when they align with context. A fitness app reminder in the morning feels helpful. The same nudge at midnight? Annoying. Matching delivery times to user habits goes a long way in building positive engagement.
    
4. Segment your users
    
Not every user wants the same message. Segment by region, preferences, or context to keep notifications relevant. A promo for a local event makes sense only if the user is nearby, while a global update can go to everyone. Smart segmentation helps you avoid noise and keeps communication personal.
    

# FAQ

1. **What are push notifications?**

Push notifications are short messages sent from your app to a user’s device, even when the app isn’t open. They show up on the lock screen or browser, giving you a direct way to grab attention. At their best, they’re quick nudges that remind users of something useful, like a delivery update or a new feature worth trying.

2. **Does Appwrite support push notifications to different platforms?**

Yes. With Appwrite, you can send both **mobile push notifications** (iOS and Android) and **web push notifications**. You can also target by **topics** (groups of users) or individual **user IDs**, giving you flexibility to broadcast updates or send highly personalized messages.

3. **How does Appwrite handle push notifications compared to Firebase?**

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is still required for Android push notifications, since that’s how messages reach devices on that platform. The difference is in how you work with it. With Firebase, you’re tied to Google’s ecosystem and usage-based pricing that can grow quickly as you scale.

Appwrite takes a developer-first approach. You still configure APNs (for Apple) and FCM (for Android/Web), but once connected, Appwrite’s SDKs handle the complexity for you. Instead of writing custom logic for tokens, segmentation, or scheduling, you use a consistent API across platforms.

And you get the freedom to choose how you run it: self-host for full control, or use **Appwrite Cloud** for a managed experience that removes the hassle of setup and maintenance. Either way, you get reliable push notifications without vendor lock-in, plus the simplicity of Appwrite’s unified developer experience.

4. **Does Appwrite support targeting users or groups with notifications?**

It does. Appwrite lets you define [topics](/docs/products/messaging/topics) and [targets](/docs/products/messaging/targets), so you can send messages to specific groups (like “premium users” or “sports fans”) or to individuals. This makes it easy to build personalized campaigns without writing complex custom logic.

5. **Which providers does Appwrite support for push notifications?**

Appwrite lets you connect with the major push services directly:

- **APNs** – Apple’s Push Notification service, used to send notifications to iOS and other Apple devices.
- **FCM** – Firebase Cloud Messaging, which works across Android, iOS, and the web.

Once you configure one of these providers, Appwrite handles the rest, so you can send notifications from a single platform without juggling separate integrations.

6. **How easy is it to set up notifications in Appwrite?**

If you’re already using Appwrite, setting up notifications is straightforward. You can configure your project, connect your app to the supported platforms (APNs, FCM), and start sending with just a few lines of code. 

7. **Is Appwrite a good fit for enterprises that need push notifications?**

Yes. Enterprises often need more than just sending messages. They care about **scalability, compliance, and control**. 

With Appwrite, you can self-host to keep everything in your own infrastructure, or use [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/) for a fully managed setup. 

Either way, you get support for APNs and FCM, user targeting, and the flexibility to integrate notifications with authentication, databases, hosting, and other backend services. That means less vendor sprawl and more confidence in meeting enterprise requirements.

8. **How do I send push notifications with Appwrite?**

You can get started in just four steps:

1. **Add a provider-** Configure APNs (Apple) or FCM (Android/Web).
2. **Register targets-** Your app collects device tokens and registers them with Appwrite.
3. **Request permissions-** Make sure users grant notification permissions.
4. **Send a message-** Create and deliver your push notification via the Appwrite Console or SDK.
