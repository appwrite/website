Nearly [70% of startups fail](https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics/) within 2-5 years of starting operations, and while many factors contribute to this, one key factor is developing a product that doesn't align with customer needs.

Founders often invest all their time, energy, and resources into solving a problem that might not be as important to their audience as they initially thought. But what if you can avoid this and build something that people care about? And that's exactly what MVP is meant for.

In this blog, we'll explain what exactly an MVP is, why it matters, and the fastest path to build an MVP for your startup.

# What is an MVP?

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the quickest, simplest version of your product that solves a key problem for your target audience. Think of it as a first draft of your product, a way to get your product into the hands of real users as soon as possible, get real feedback, and improve it based on their needs.

## Key things to consider

While there are many factors to consider when building an MVP, the key is to focus on things that help you maximize learning and minimize risk as much as possible. So here are two important things to consider:

### Speed drives quick feedback

Startups don't have the luxury of time. You ship, you break things, you fix them fast. If you're moving slowly, you're already behind. Instead of spending months on research, surveys, and perfecting the product, get your MVP into the hands of real users as quickly as possible. The sooner you do, the sooner you can learn what works and what doesn't.

That's exactly what UNDO, a software company part of Appwrite's Startup Program, did. After discovering product-market fit, Jonas, co-founder of UNDO, rapidly started developing the solution. As a solo developer, he needed a fast, scalable solution. That's when he turned to Appwrite, leveraging its backend-as-a-service platform to speed up development and scale seamlessly.

### Focus on early adopters

Early adopters are key to your MVP's success. These are the users with their hair on fire, which means they have a pressing real problem and are even willing to use an imperfect product to solve it. So, by focusing on the early adopters, you can ensure that your MVP evolves with the users' needs while also building a loyal customer base from the start.

# Practical tips for building an MVP quickly

Now that you know what an MVP is and the key things you should consider, let's cover some practical tips that help you build an MVP quickly:

## Set a clear deadline
You don't have to spend too much time overthinking and iterating endlessly. Instead, give yourself a specific timeline (e.g., 2 weeks to 1 month) to build an MVP.

## Write down a spec
Clearly define the features your MVP must have to avoid getting stuck in constant feature debates. Your MVP should have just enough to solve a specific problem. Don't worry about extras.

## Cut back on features
Review your spec and remove anything that isn't absolutely necessary to solve the core customer problem. Ask yourself, "Does this feature solve an urgent problem for the user?" If not, remove it.

## Don't fall in love with your MVP
The MVP is just a starting point, and it will change over time. So don't fall in love with your MVP. Fall in love with your customers and their pain points. That's how you win in the long-term.

# Common pitfalls to avoid

## Overcomplicating your MVP

As already mentioned, during MVP phase you don't have to build a product that does everything. Don't overcomplicate your MVP, just focus on solving a core problem. This can help you avoid  delays, wasted resources, and an unfocused product.

For instance, adding advanced analytics, customizable dashboards, or integrations with multiple third-party services can slow you down when you should actually be focusing on solving the core problem.

## The fear of rejection

Founders often fear that if users don't like the MVP, it will ruin their business. But negative feedback is valuable. It shows where improvements are needed. And probably, your startup doesn't die just because one customer doesn't like the product.

## Underestimating scalability needs

Founders often build an MVP without considering future scalability, resulting in products that cannot scale as user demand grows. Even in the MVP phase, think about scalability. Build a flexible, scalable infrastructure that can handle future growth.

# Examples MVPs that turned into successful products

There's no right or wrong way to build an MVP. Many big companies kicked off with MVPs. Some got started with just a short demo video, while others with a lean MVP. However, in all cases, they began with very limited functionality that solved a real problem for a small group of early users.

Here are two of the best examples:

## **Dropbox**

Did you know Dropbox just started out with a simple demo video? They launched with an MVP, a short demo video of their product to test market demand before investing heavily in product. This strategy allowed them validate their idea and attract early adopters.

## **Stripe**

Stripe, now a global payments leader, began with a simple, lean MVP focused on a clean API for accepting payments without integrating full financial infrastructure. With a tight feedback loop and rapid iterations, they refined the product based on real user needs.

# Conclusion

Building an MVP can be overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. With the right mindset and tools, you can focus on solving real problems. By prioritizing speed, engaging early adopters, and iterating quickly based on feedback, you can bring your idea to life efficiently.

Just like **UNDO**, which went from idea to first customer in 2-3 months using Appwrite's backend-as-a-service platform:
