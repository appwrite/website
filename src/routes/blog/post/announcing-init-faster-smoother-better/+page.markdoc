The first [Init](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-init) earlier this year was a blast, and all of you who joined made it a week to remember and will go down in the history of Appwrite. Now we’re back with another Init to celebrate everything new with Appwrite. Faster. Smoother. Better.

# Discord events

Just like last time, but not quite like last time, we will host Discord sessions with special guests from the community. We’re also hosting a live coding session led by our very own Dennis Ivy. 

The special guest who will be joining will be announced next week. So keep an eye out for our social media!

You can find the full list of events [here and RVSP](https://apwr.dev/InitKickOff).

# Limited edition Init swags

What would Init be without its limited-edition swags? We’re sticking to our theme and setting you up with a swag Performance kit. 

What’s inside? Special edition socks, a water bottle, sweatpants, and a vest.
