Building web applications requires both front-end expertise and back-end infrastructure. [Appwrite Sites](/products/sites) simplifies this process by providing a platform for deploying, hosting, and scaling web applications.

To ease this process even further, Appwrite Sites offers a variety of starter kits for popular frameworks like Next.js, React, Vue, Nuxt, Angular, SvelteKit, and Flutter. In this blog, you will learn how to set up the Nuxt starter template and deploy it to Appwrite Sites.

# Overview of the starter template

Nuxt is a framework built on top of Vue.js that makes it easy to develop server-rendered, statically generated, or single-page applications with features like routing, SEO optimization, and modular architecture out of the box.

Appwrite's Nuxt starter template includes:

- A clean, single-page UI
- Integration with Appwrite's SDK
- Pre-configured deployment settings for Appwrite Sites' SSR rendering strategy

# Deploy the starter template on Appwrite

Firstly, you must head to Appwrite Cloud and [create an account](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/register) if you haven't already (or [self-host Appwrite 1.7](/docs/advanced/self-hosting)). Next, create your first project, which will lead you to the project overview page.

![Add platform](/images/blog/nuxt-starter-sites/add-platform.png)

Head to the **Sites** page from the left sidebar, click on the **Create site** button, and select the **Clone a template** option. This will take you to the Appwrite Sites templates listing, where you should search `Nuxt starter` and click on the template.

After selecting the template, you can choose to connect a GitHub repository now or at a later time. If you choose to connect a repository, ensure you select a production branch (leave the root directory as is). Then, review the preset environment variables, update the domain name if you want, and click on the **Deploy** button. You can watch the deployment logs as the site is built.

{% info title="Alternative method to deploy starter template" %}

As an alternative to the Appwrite console, you can create and deploy websites using the [Appwrite CLI](/docs/products/sites/deploy-manually#cli). Create your Nuxt starter using the following shell command and configuration:

```bash
appwrite init sites
? What would you like to name your site? Nuxt starter
? What ID would you like to have for your site? unique()
? What framework would you like to use? Nuxt (nuxt)
? What specification would you like to use? 0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM
```

You can then make any edits to the website and deploy it using the following command:

```bash
appwrite push sites
```

{% /info %}

# Test the starter template

After your site has been successfully deployed, Appwrite will show you a **Congratulations** page. You can then either choose to view the site by clicking on the **Visit site** button or view the site configuration (deployments, logs, domains, usage, and settings) by clicking on the **Go to dashboard** button.

And with that, the Nuxt starter kit is deployed to Appwrite Sites. You can explore other templates or deploy any other websites you'd like.
