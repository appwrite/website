Welcome back to the April product update. Last month, we dropped some big updates:

- The Appwrite Network is now live
- Appwrite authentication kit library for FlutterFlow
- RxDB Integration is here

So let’s dive in.

# New cloud regions

In April, we launched the Appwrite Network, our vision for a globally distributed cloud regions and edge locations. 

With the launch of two new cloud regions (New York City and Sydney) and more to come soon, you can choose where your data sits and optimise it for reduced latency and improved performance.

So you can now create your projects in:

- New York City (NYC)
- Sydney (SYD)
- Frankfurt (FRA)

# Appwrite authentication kit for FlutterFlow

Did you know Appwrite now has an authentication kit library for FlutterFlow?

Which means now you don’t have to build authentication from scratch for your FlutterFlow apps. 

Instead, you can simply use the kit to implement secure user authentication with just a few clicks.

Check out our full documentation for how to get it up and running.

# RxDB replication plugin

Offline support for applications has been the second most requested feature on our GitHub repository.

Therefore, we announced a direct integration of Appwrite databases with RxDB, a local-first NoSQL database designed for JavaScript apps.

So now it's easier than ever to build real-world apps that stay in sync online and offline.

# Big announcement coming soon

We teased it last time, and now it's almost here. We’ve got a big announcement very soon.

No spoilers (yet), but all we can say is that this announcement will change the way you build with Appwrite. 

We’ve been heads down, building something big, and we’re just as excited as you are to bring it to life. So visit our ‘Coming Soon’ page and click **Notify Me** to get an email when we go live.
