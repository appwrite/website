Our new Integrations Catalog is designed to empower you by providing a seamless way to integrate your favorite tools, libraries, and services with Appwrite, making your development process even more efficient and enjoyable.

# One-stop shop for all your integrations

You’re building your next big project on top of Appwrite; your backend is all set up and ready to go to production. But then you realize you need a way to sell subscriptions and send emails, and you’ve decided at the last minute you want to add more OAuth2 providers. Imagine you had to build all these integrations for your app from scratch in a short space of time. With the new [Integrations Catalog](https://appwrite.io/integrations), we have done the heavy lifting for you. You’ll find integrations for both Cloud and Self-hosted that cater to every aspect of your development needs, allowing you to build your app exactly as you intended.

# What’s inside the Appwrite Integrations Catalog?

We’ve bundled all integrations into different categories. Here are a few notable providers (with many more to come!). Check out the full catalog on the Integrations page. 

## Authentication

- [Phone auth](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/phone-sms)

Phone auth allows you to authenticate users using One-Time Passwords (OTPs) sent to their mobile phones via SMS, making it a highly-convenient passwordless alternative to email-password authentication. You can use Twilio to enable phone authentication for your apps.

- [OAuth2](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/oauth2)

You can set up OAuth2 with over 30 providers. OAuth is a way for apps to request limited access to a user's account on another service without needing the user's password. This keeps the user’s account more secure while making signing up and logging in all the more convenient. 

Some of Appwrite’s OAuth integrations include Amazon, Appwrite, Discord, Google, and Notion.

## Deployments

- [GitHub](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/functions)

We've integrated GitHub to simplify your development workflow with Appwrite Functions. This integration enables the generation of repositories for function templates and manages automatic deployments for any Appwrite Functions through GitHub.

## Messaging

- [Twilio](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging/twilio) for SMS

You can use the Twilio provider in Appwrite Messaging to send customized SMS messages to your users. Whether you need to send them instantly or schedule them for later, these messages can serve a variety of purposes like reminders, promotions, announcements, and even custom authentication flows.

- [Sendgrid](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging/sendgrid) for Email

Send custom emails to your users with Sendgrid, either instantly or on a schedule. Use it to deliver reminders, promotions, and announcements, keeping your audience engaged and informed.

- [APNs and FCM](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging/send-push-notifications) for Push notifications

Use Apple Push Notifications service (APNs) or Firebase Cloud Messaging to send in-app or push notifications. Deliver app updates, promotional offers, and other messages straight to your users’ devices.

- [Vonage](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging/vonage) for WhatsApp messages

Going one step further? Use Vonage to send WhatsApp messages and connect with your users in a modern, user-friendly way.

## Storage

- Amazon S3

Store your files on self-hosted instances with Amazon S3. Amazon S3 provides scalable object storage that allows you to manage and access your data seamlessly, ensuring high availability and durability.

## Logging

Monitor your application's performance by tracing errors across your Appwrite instance and fixing them faster. These tools help you proactively manage issues and deliver a more stable experience: 

- Sentry
- Raygun
- AppSignal

## AI

- Hugging Face and Generative AI

Enhance your app with AI through Appwrite's integrations. Build [with our AI function templates](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/building-with-ai-function-templates) from popular tools like Hugging Face, OpenAI, Perplexity, and more. Imagine creating [your very own AI chatbot](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/personal-chatbot-gpt-4o) with OpenAI’s GPT-4o — it's easier than you think!

## Payments

- Stripe

Use Stripe to set up app [subscriptions](https://appwrite.io/docs/tutorials/subscriptions-with-stripe/step-1) and payments. It's designed to be straightforward so you can smoothly manage your transactions.

- Lemon Squeezy

Lemon Squeezy lets you set up payments and subscriptions quickly, so you can focus on your app’s functionality. Check out [this video for a step-by-step guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHo7lvpU6gs).

## Databases

- MongoDB Atlas and Upstash Vector

Easily manage your data using MongoDB Atlas and Upstash Vector integration. MongoDB Atlas offers a flexible database solution, and Upstash Vector improves query capabilities for fast and reliable data access. Together, they help you manage data efficiently and boost your app’s performance.

## Search

- Algolia

Improve your app’s search functionality with the Algolia integration. Algolia makes it straightforward to integrate practical search features, helping users easily find the information they need without hassle.

# Designed with your experience in mind

As with everything we do here at Appwrite, we heavily focus on the developer experience. Our main goal with the Integration Catalog is to meet your needs when integrating X with Appwrite. We focused on a set of principles that helped us deliver on our promise:

1. Appwrite developers need quick access to integration options, including everything provided in the console and future integrations.
2. Categories should group integrations, and a consistent hierarchy of information should exist on every page.
3. Finding new categories should be logical, intuitive, and fast.
4. The content should be presented in an easy-to-digest manner and help you find what you’re looking for.
