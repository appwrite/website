There's no shortage of AI development tools in 2025. Most of them promise the same thing: describe what you want, and let the assistant scaffold it for you. But if you've spent real time building with these tools, debugging, testing or revisiting logic days later, you know the marketing stops mattering pretty quickly.

I've used Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Lovable, and Bolt over real projects. Each tool claims to handle code context, planning, editing, and generation. Some come closer than others. All of them fail at times. What separates them is not really how "smart" they are on paper, but how they hold up when you're adding features, facing bugs, or trying to build something that needs to last longer than a sprint.

This comparison is based on extended, practical use of each tool in full-stack applications. It looks at where each one succeeds, where it fails, and how their capabilities hold up in real-world use.

# VS Code with GitHub Copilot

A year ago, Copilot felt like it was falling behind other tools. Today, it has caught up and, more importantly, has become easier to trust. What used to function as a smart autocomplete layer has become something more substantial, with an agent mode that handles file generation, multi-step instructions, and project-aware changes.

Its main strength is its smooth integration with VS Code. There is no friction, no need to adopt a new editor or adjust your workflow. It gets out of the way, supporting what you're already doing rather than trying to become your IDE. The line between Copilot and other tools like Cursor has gotten blurrier, and for many developers, Copilot now does most of the things they used to need a more specialized tool for.

The pricing is also reasonable, and hasn't been a pain to manage. You install it, connect your GitHub account, and it just works. If Copilot had stayed where it was a year ago, I wouldn't be using it for any serious work. But today, it's the one I now use as my daily driver.

That said, its inline completion is far behind Cursor and Windsurf. It struggles to understand file context or make meaningful suggestions (when compared to Cursor). This is not a deal breaker, but it's something to consider.

# Cursor for vibe coding

Cursor remains one of the most technically capable AI development environments, built for deep structural work. Its strength is control. It allows for structured instructions, file referencing, and project-specific rules (`.cursorrules`), enabling it to perform complex rewrites when guided well. The recent pricing update, with its unlimited auto mode, makes it easier to use for daily workflows.

Cursor now prices its usage based on tokens instead of number of requests. They add markups to the rates of high-end models like Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's GPT-5. Its auto mode, however, routes to different models depending on complexity of the prompt, is billed at a fixed token rate, and works surprisingly well.

However, I've noticed that on large codebases, Cursor can lag, freeze while indexing, or stall on file edits, even on high-performance computers (I use a MacBook M3 Pro). This is probably the same experience other similar AI editors might have, since they're mostly all VS Code forks.

I still recommend it for serious work, although I've been using it less and less.

# Windsurf for vibe coding

Windsurf offers a clean interface and behaves predictably, making it a decent assistant for front-end or mid-sized projects. Edits are applied directly, giving a sense of immediate feedback with little configuration needed.

The tool is held back by two key issues. The first is its pricing model, which caps requests at 500 per month on its base paid tier, a limit that professional developers can hit quickly. The second is a lack of trust in its long-term direction, especially after its founders departed for Google. Every other thing about how Windsurf works is similar to Cursor, although I prefer some of the UI elements in Windsurf, and they seem to go an extra mile in making their user experience friendlier.

# Bolt for vibe coding

Bolt takes a different approach, running entirely in the browser and using integrated features to generate full-stack applications.

![Bolt web interface](/images/blog/comparing-vibe-coding-tools/bolt.webp)

For scaffolding projects with a frontend, backend, and database, Bolt performs well. It generates sensible file structures and code that is more consistent than similar tools. One thing to note is that Bolt rewrites entire files when making edits, rather than targeting specific code sections like traditional code editors. Since Bolt prices based on token usage, rewriting entire files for minor changes quickly depletes user tokens, which can make it expensive for iterative development.

Bolt shows good promise for prototyping and its outputs are usually clean. Although it doesn't yet come across as a full development environment. As logic complexity increases, the output requires extensive restructuring, and developers will likely need to export the code to finish it elsewhere. Generally, I find Bolt great for quick prototypes but less suitable for ongoing development work.

# Lovable for vibe coding

Lovable is designed for speed, and tries to position itself as the fastest way to get from a prompt to a working web application. For landing pages, internal tools, or demos, it delivers a smooth experience, and can spin up a live frontend with a clean aesthetic that can be tweaked through a visual editor.

![Lovable interface](/images/blog/comparing-vibe-coding-tools/lovable.webp)

Lovable is similar to Bolt in more ways than it is to other tools like Cursor and Windsurf. This means that just like with Bolt, as soon as requirements shift from the standard quick prototypes and templates, the assistant can become less helpful. Generally, I've found lovable to be more polished at the UI/UX level but less structured under the hood.

That said, a lot of non-developers are already using it daily to build out their ideas without much hassle, and this is a good strength for Lovable.

# Claude Code for vibe coding

Claude Code operates in your terminal, which feels like a step backward until you realize it's actually solving a different problem. Instead of another VS Code fork, Anthropic built something that works where many developers already spend their time.

![Claude Code terminal interface](/images/blog/comparing-vibe-coding-tools/claude-code.webp)

There's no UI to learn, but that also means no visual feedback during longer operations. You're trusting that it understands your codebase correctly, which it often does, but when it doesn't, debugging becomes more difficult than with GUI-based tools.

The pricing structure is where things get complicated. Claude Code starts at $20/month for the Pro plan, which gives you roughly 10-40 prompts every five hours. This limits its usefulness for larger projects.

The Max plans at $100-200/month provide more capacity, but the usage limitations scale with complexity. The terminal-only approach doesn't appeal to me, but many developers report that Claude performs better via Claude Code than when accessed through other tools. So I'd say it's worth a try despite the pricing.

- **Claude Code**: Pricing from $20-200/month with usage limits that vary by codebase size. Pro plan works best for smaller repositories, with higher tiers needed for larger projects.

# Final thoughts

A year ago, the choice for serious AI-assisted development seemed clear. Today, the lines are blurring. GitHub Copilot which used to be an afterthought has matured into a good default that is easy to adopt.

Cursor excels at structured, large-scale changes. Windsurf offers a clean user flow with its business model raising questions about long-term viability. Claude Code brings unique terminal-only focus that appeal to command-line focused developers. Bolt and Lovable are good for rapid prototyping and scaffolding, though I've found them best suited for specific use cases rather than full development workflows.

All these tools can generate code, but the real difference is how they behave when it matters, when the codebase is large, the deadline is tight, and you need an assistant that helps more than it hinders. Developers who understand the edges of each platform will have a good advantage in this new era of AI-assisted development.
