When building applications with Appwrite, developers often need a way to test and debug services repeatedly over short periods. Sometimes, this can become a hassle, as Appwrite enforces strict rate limits on client apps to prevent abuse. Developers needed a way to bypass these rate limits in their test environments and CI/CD workflows to ensure the robustness of their app functionalities.

And this is the exact problem **dev keys** are here to solve!

# What are dev keys?

Dev keys are a type of secret used by Appwrite's client SDKs. They allow the developer to bypass any rate limits enforced by Appwrite and suppress any CORS errors caused by not using a configured hostname. A developer can configure the expiration date of a dev key to any of the three preset options (1 day, 7 days, or 30 days).

Dev keys should never be used in production environments, as they can make your app more susceptible to abuse and security breaches.

# Try out dev keys in an app

To test dev keys, I created a simple demo web app that sends 200 requests to create a new row in an Appwrite database. To set this app up, you must complete the following steps:

## Step 1: Setup Appwrite project

First, create an [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io) account or [self-host Appwrite 1.7](/docs/advanced/self-hosting). Create a project (which will lead you to the project overview page) and head to the **Databases** page from the left sidebar. Create a new database with the ID `testDb` and a new table with the ID `testTable`. Store both of these IDs for future usage. In this table, add the following column:

| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `number` | Integer | True |

Then, head to the **Settings** tab of the table, scroll down to the **Permissions** section, and add the following permissions:

|  | Create | Read | Update | Delete |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any | False | False | False | False |

Lastly, return to the project overview page, head to the **Settings** page from the left sidebar, and copy your **API endpoint** and **project ID** for future usage.

## Step 2: Create web app

Next up, we'll create our test app. This will require us to create two files in our working directory:

- `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dev keys demo</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Dev keys demo</h1>
    <p>Click on this button to add 200 rows to the database in less than 1 minute.</p>
    <button type="button">Add rows</button>

    <!-- Appwrite Web SDK -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appwrite@18.1.1"></script>

    <!-- Our app's script -->
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

- `app.js`

```js
const client = new Appwrite.Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'); // Your project ID

const database = new Appwrite.Databases(client);

document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const promises = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
        const promise = database.createDocument(
        'testDb', // Your database ID
        'testTable', // Your table ID
        Appwrite.ID.unique(),
        { number: i + i }
        );
        promises.push(promise);
        console.log('Request initiated:', i+1);
    }

    await Promise.all(promises);
});
```

If you open the HTML page in your browser and click on the `Add rows` button, you will notice numerous errors in the console with the HTTP code `429`, as Appwrite's rate limits allow one client to create 120 requests per minute for this API endpoint.

## Step 3: Create dev key

Head back to your Appwrite project. On the overview page, select the **Dev keys** tab under the Integrations section and create a new dev key. You can add whatever name and expiry date you like.

After creating this dev key, head to the `app.js` file and update the Appwrite client to the following:

```js
const client = new Appwrite.Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>')
    .setDevKey('<YOUR_DEV_KEY>'); // Your dev key
```

## Step 4: Test the app

Reopen the HTML page in your browser. Clicking the `Add rows` button will allow all 200 requests to execute successfully.
