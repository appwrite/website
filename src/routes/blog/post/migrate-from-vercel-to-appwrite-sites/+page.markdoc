If you’ve been hosting on Vercel, you’ve probably grown used to a deployment workflow that feels effortless. Git push, automatic builds, instant previews, and a global network behind you. Migrating away from that level of convenience can feel like a step backwards, but with Appwrite Sites, it’s the exact opposite. You get the same smooth developer experience, with more power, more flexibility, and a better cost structure behind it.

Here’s why teams are making the move without hesitation.

# 1. Same great git push workflow

The most painful part of switching platforms is often the workflow disruption. Appwrite Sites eliminates that entirely. Your developers don’t have to learn new [deployment](/docs/products/sites/deployments) commands or rewire their CI/CD pipelines. You push your code to Git, Appwrite detects your repository, builds your project, and automatically deploys it. You get instant [preview environments](/docs/products/sites/previews) for every pull request, just like you’re used to on Vercel.

For teams that have invested years into refining their workflows, this kind of familiarity matters. It allows you to migrate without slowing down development or retraining your team. The move becomes almost invisible, except for the benefits that follow.

# 2. Full Next.js support without quirks

If you’ve ever had to adjust a Next.js project to fit a hosting provider’s limitations, you know how much friction that can introduce. Appwrite Sites runs on containers, not restrictive serverless runtimes. That means your Next.js app runs exactly as it was designed to.

No workarounds. No “open next” patches. No custom build steps. Whether you rely on static rendering, SSR, middleware, or API routes, everything behaves as expected. It’s the same Next.js your team has already built and optimized, just deployed on a platform that gives you full control over your runtime.

# 3. Global delivery powered by multiple CDNs

Appwrite’s network architecture is built for scale from day one. Under the hood, Appwrite Sites uses a [multi-CDN](/docs/products/network/cdn) setup that combines several top-tier CDN providers into a single, globally distributed edge layer. This means your users automatically get routed through the fastest and most reliable network paths, no matter where they are in the world.

For you, that translates into consistent performance, lower latency, and high availability without having to think about the infrastructure behind it. You get to work with a modern, shiny product, but the actual delivery layer is backed by some of the most battle-proven CDN technologies in the industry. It’s the best of both worlds, modern DX with enterprise-grade reliability.

# 4. A cost structure built to scale

Great developer experience shouldn’t come at a premium that scales out of control. One of the biggest reasons teams are switching to Appwrite Sites is cost. Every deployment comes with 2TB of bandwidth included in the base plan, and volume discounts are available to any team migrating from Vercel.

This isn’t just about being cheaper on paper. It’s about predictability. You can scale your traffic, onboard more users, or ship larger apps without constantly worrying about hidden overages or sudden spikes in your bill. Appwrite’s pricing was designed to support growth, not penalize it.

# 5. More than hosting. A full cloud platform

Appwrite Sites is just the entry point. Behind it stands the full Appwrite Cloud platform: a set of deeply integrated products designed to help teams build entire applications in one place.

Your frontend can be hosted on Sites, your backend logic can run in [Appwrite Functions](/docs/products/functions), your data can live in [Appwrite Databases](/docs/products/databases), and your assets can be stored in Appwrite Storage. Realtime updates and messaging can keep your apps dynamic and engaging, while [Appwrite Auth](/docs/products/auth) provides secure and flexible authentication built right into the platform.

Everything works great individually, but when combined, they create a single cohesive development and deployment experience. For teams tired of stitching together multiple services, this integrated approach is a huge win. It simplifies architecture, improves maintainability, and removes the need for countless third-party dependencies.

# 6. Open source by design

Appwrite is fully open source, and that’s not just a nice-to-have. It’s a fundamental difference in how the platform operates. You can look under the hood, understand exactly how things work, and contribute if you want to. There’s no black box or hidden lock-in.

If your company ever outgrows the cloud platform or needs to move workloads on-prem, you can [self-host](/docs/advanced/self-hosting). That level of control and transparency is rare in modern cloud platforms, and it gives technical leaders the confidence to build on top of Appwrite for the long term.

# 7. A migration path that doesn’t hurt

Migrations are often underestimated in complexity. Appwrite Sites was built to make that process as painless as possible. If you’re running a Next.js app, a React SPA, or any modern frontend framework, [you can migrate](/docs/products/sites/migrations/vercel) without refactoring your application.

Your repos stay the same. Your build commands stay the same. Your deployments stay the same. You just point your project to Appwrite and push. In most cases, teams are able to go live within a day, and in many, within an hour.

# Wrapping up

Migrating from Vercel doesn’t mean giving up the workflow you love. It means keeping the same great developer experience, while gaining a more flexible runtime, better network performance, a lower and more predictable cost structure, and access to a full cloud platform that can power your entire stack.

For teams that want modern DX without compromise, Appwrite Sites is the logical next step. If your team is ready to make the move, we’ve made it simple to get started - and we can support you through the migration if you need a hand.
