One-time password (OTP) logins with SMS provide a secure and convenient way for users to authenticate themselves, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access accounts. By sending a temporary, time-sensitive code via SMS, phone OTP logins offer a strong layer of security, helping prevent unauthorized access and protecting user data. This service has become a crucial part of many applications, and we've worked hard to make it as easy and scalable as possible.

When we launched Appwrite Cloud in beta, we focused on enabling the platform and providing you with as much value as possible. We intentionally didn't charge for every service, even in cases where we were absorbing significant costs ourselves - like phone OTP logins, where sending SMS messages through various telecom companies incurred a considerable expense.

In the last few months, we've worked tirelessly with various vendors, navigating complex regulations and bureaucracy in multiple countries to ensure excellent phone OTP message delivery. Our goal was always to integrate phone OTP logins as simply as possible while providing a scalable and reliable service.

It's been incredibly rewarding to see teams successfully implement phone OTP logins, using Appwrite to authenticate hundreds of thousands of users every month securely. Seeing this impact reinforces the importance of continuing to build a secure, accessible, and sustainable platform.

# Pricing update

As Appwrite continues to grow, we need to ensure that the platform remains sustainable and that we can provide the best possible service to all our users. Starting February 10th, we will begin charging for phone OTP login attempts. This change will help cover the costs associated with providing this valuable service and allow us to keep improving and expanding the platform.

Please refer to our [rates page](/docs/advanced/platform/phone-otp#rates) for a breakdown of the new pricing, including rates by region and specific SMS costs.

To help prepare for these changes, each team can visit their organization's usage page or the usage section of a specific project to review their current phone OTP usage. This will help you better understand your usage patterns and plan accordingly.

# Free quota available

To ensure that free users can continue exploring the platform and its features, we will provide up to 10 phone OTP login attempts per month at no charge. This will allow you to continue utilizing OTP logins to evaluate Appwrite's capabilities and integration into your workflows.
