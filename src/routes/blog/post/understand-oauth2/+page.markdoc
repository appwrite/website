In todayâ€™s interconnected app ecosystem, users expect seamless, secure access across services. OAuth 2.0 has emerged as the industry standard for handling secure delegated access, making it a critical protocol for developers to understand.

This guide explains OAuth 2.0, how it works, the different flows available, and when to use each one, helping you build secure, scalable authorization experiences.

# What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authorization. It allows users to grant limited access to their resources on one service to another service without sharing credentials.

Rather than handing out a username and password, users authorize apps to act on their behalf using access tokens. OAuth 2.0 ensures that:

- Apps never directly handle user credentials.
- Users retain control over what permissions they grant.
- Access can be easily revoked.

# Core components of OAuth 2.0

Before diving into the flows, it's important to understand the key players:

- **Resource Owner**: The user who authorizes access to their data.
- **Client**: The application requesting access.
- **Authorization Server**: Issues access tokens after authenticating the user.
- **Resource Server**: Hosts the protected resources.

These components work together to ensure secure authorization across systems.

Refer to the OAuth2 [documentation](/docs/product/auth/oauth2) for complete technical details.

# How OAuth 2.0 works: A simple flow

1. **Authorization request**: The client asks the resource owner for permission.
2. **Authorization grant**: If the user consents, the server issues a grant (authorization code, token, etc.).
3. **Token request**: The client exchanges the grant for an access token.
4. **Resource access**: The client uses the token to access protected resources.

Tokens are typically short-lived and scoped, meaning they only allow the operations the user approved.

# Major OAuth 2.0 flows

OAuth 2.0 offers different "flows" to accommodate various scenarios. Here's a breakdown of the major ones:

## 1. Authorization code flow

**Best for**: Server-side applications

- User authenticates via browser.
- Client receives an authorization code.
- Server exchanges the code for an access token.

**Advantages**:

- Highly secure (authorization code exchanged server-side).
- Supports refresh tokens.

**Typical use cases**:

- Web apps with secure backend servers.

## 2. Authorization code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

**Best for**: Mobile and SPA (Single Page Applications)

- Similar to Authorization Code Flow, but with an added security layer (PKCE).
- Prevents interception attacks.

**Advantages**:

- Stronger protection for public clients.

**Typical use cases**:

- Mobile apps, SPAs.

## 3. Client credentials flow

**Best for**: Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication

- No user interaction.
- Client authenticates itself to obtain an access token.

**Advantages**:

- Efficient for service-to-service communication.

**Typical use cases**:

- APIs accessed by backend services.

## 4. Implicit Flow (Legacy)

**Best for**: SPAs (historically)

- Tokens returned directly in browser URL.
- Faster but less secure.

**Note**: Now largely replaced by Authorization Code Flow with PKCE due to security risks.

## 5. Device authorization flow

**Best for**: Devices without browsers/keyboards

- User authenticates on a separate device.
- Device polls authorization server for approval.

**Typical use cases**:

- Smart TVs, IoT devices.

# OAuth 2.0 Tokens: Access and refresh

OAuth 2.0 commonly uses two types of tokens:

- **Access Token**: Grants access to protected resources.
- **Refresh Token**: Used to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating the user.

Tokens are often JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) containing claims about the user and the permissions granted.

# When to Use OAuth 2.0

- **Third-party integrations**: Allowing users to connect external services securely.
- **APIs**: Protecting APIs from unauthorized access.
- **Mobile and web Apps**: Enabling secure login and data access without managing credentials.
- **B2B applications**: Secure service-to-service communication.

# Common OAuth 2.0 pitfalls

- **Over-scoped tokens**: Granting too many permissions.
- **Insecure storage**: Storing tokens in insecure locations (e.g., localStorage without encryption).
- **Ignoring token expiration**: Failing to handle token refresh flows.
- **Misusing Implicit Flow**: Using legacy flows where better options (PKCE) are available.

# OAuth 2.0: A key enabler of modern security

OAuth 2.0 powers secure, flexible authorization across the modern internet. Understanding its core flows and best practices helps developers build safer, more user-friendly apps.

Choosing the proper OAuth 2.0 flow based on your application's architecture and user needs is critical to balancing security, usability, and scalability.
