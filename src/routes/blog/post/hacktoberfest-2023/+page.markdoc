-   Once your PR is ready, link the PR in the issue and tag a maintainer to let them know it is ready for review
-   Your PR will be confirmed within 7 days, and if it's accepted, we will label it as `hacktoberfest-accepted`

### 4. Get Support:

-   Our maintainers are here to assist, guide, and mentor you through your contribution. Need alternative ways to contribute or additional help? Contact us on [Discord](https://appwrite.io/discord)!
