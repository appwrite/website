Welcome back to the July Product Update. This month, we have made many, many great releases!

Here’s what to expect:

* Appwrite Sites is now available to all
* Many new Databases features
* Console improvements
* Improved notification previews

Let’s dive in.

# Appwrite Sites live for all

![Sites live for all](/images/changelog/2025-07-24.png)

Here’s an update many of you’ve been waiting for: Appwrite Sites is now live for all!

You can now host your applications directly from the Appwrite console, making Appwrite an all-in-one development platform to develop, deploy, and scale your apps.

# CSV import

![CSV imports](/images/blog/announcing-csv-imports/cover.png)

We started July with CSV import.  Built on top of Appwrite's migration APIs, this Databases feature makes it easy to bring in large datasets, seed collections, or migrate structured data using only a CSV file.

# Bulk API

You can now handle heavy data workloads with greater ease. With Bulk API, you can create, update, delete, or upsert multiple documents in a single API call.

This is especially useful for managing large datasets or syncing data between systems without multiple API calls.

# Database Upsert

![Database Upsert](/images/blog/announcing-database-upsert/cover.png)

Database Upsert lets you create or update a document with a single API call. If the document exists, it’s updated; if not, it’s created. This removes the need for manual existence checks, reduces extra requests, and simplifies your logic.

# Encrypted string attribute support

![Encrypted ](/images/blog/announcing-encrypted-string-attributes/cover.png)

We’ve added an extra layer of security to Appwrite Databases and Storage. This feature allows you to encrypt string attributes at rest directly from the Appwrite console, without needing to implement manual encryption.

# Auto increment support

![Auto-increment](/images/blog/announcing-auto-increment-support/cover.png)

Appwrite Databases now support auto-increment fields. A `$sequence` column is automatically managed in your collection, increasing with each new document. This helps keep your data ordered without requiring manual handling.

# Console and deployment improvements

![Console](/images/blog/product-update-july-2025/console.png)

We've shipped several improvements to fix broken flows and clean up the developer experience across Sites, Functions, and the Appwrite Console.

A few of them include:

- Site screenshots now use the Storage API preview route
- The Git deployment modal now auto-fills your production branch
- Domain validation status now updates in real-time

And many more. View the full changelog for more details

# Smarter notifications

![OTP](/images/blog/product-update-july-2025/otp.png)

We’ve just added new previews for all Appwrite OTP emails. End users can now view the code/OTP without opening the message.

Here’s what improved:

- Key info is shown at the top
- Notifications are cleaner and easier to read
- Clearer copy makes actions quicker and reduces confusion
