Imagine opening your IDE and asking, “Why did my last deployment fail?” and your assistant instantly pulls details from Vercel, checks Sentry for recent errors, and reviews your last commit on GitHub, all without you leaving your editor.

That’s what [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/blog/post/what-is-mcp) is enabling. It gives developer tools and AI systems a shared language so they can share context in real time. Instead of every integration being its own isolated setup, MCP makes your tools part of the same conversation.

In this blog, we’ll look at 10 awesome MCP servers and clients shaping the developer experience in 2025.

# Difference between an MCP Server and an MCP Client?

If you’re just starting to explore the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystem, it helps to understand the two main building blocks: **MCP servers** and **MCP clients**. They work together, but their roles are very different.

## What is an MCP Server?

An **MCP server** is where all the actual capabilities live. It connects tools, APIs, and data so your AI assistant can access them in a structured way. Think of it as the part that does the heavy lifting.

For example, a GitHub MCP server can let your AI fetch repo data, review pull requests, or even open new issues. A Sentry MCP server can surface recent errors, and a Stripe MCP server can pull transaction info when you’re debugging a payments flow. Basically, if it has data or an API, there can be an MCP server for it.

## What is an MCP Client?

The **MCP client** is the side you actually interact with. It’s the interface where your AI assistant lives, tools like VS Code, Cursor IDE, or Gemini CLI. The client talks to different MCP servers and turns that data into something useful while you’re coding.

So instead of jumping between dashboards, your MCP client can pull logs from Sentry, check commits from GitHub, and push code to Appwrite, all without leaving your editor.

**In short**

- MCP servers provide the capabilities
- MCP clients use them to get the work done


# 10 best MCP servers

## 2. GitHub MCP server

Tired of hopping between tabs to check commits or review pull requests? The GitHub MCP server lets your AI assistant handle it. It reads repos, opens issues, manages PRs, and even inspects CI pipelines. Everything GitHub-related, inside your coding flow.

## 5. MongoDB MCP server

The MongoDB MCP server turns your database into something you can actually talk to. Ask for schema details, run queries, or manage users, all in plain English. It’s a quick way to explore or modify data without opening the shell or console.

## 7. Stripe MCP server

Stripe’s MCP server gives your AI client access to your billing and payment data. It can create customers, invoices, and subscriptions or look up transactions and balances. Everything runs securely through OAuth, keeping your financial operations simple and contained.

Link: [Stripe MCP server](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp)

## 8. Vercel MCP server

If you deploy on Vercel, this can be helpful. The Vercel MCP server lets your assistant view build logs, check recent deployments, or roll back a release with a single prompt. It keeps the deployment context close to your code.

## 9. Sequential Thinking MCP server

This server helps AI tools reason through complex tasks. It can break a problem into smaller steps, explore different options, and refine answers along the way. It’s built for situations where careful, step-by-step thinking leads to better results.

## 10. Neon MCP server

Neon’s MCP server connects your AI client to your Postgres databases. It can create projects, run queries, manage branches, and handle migrations through natural language. It’s a straightforward way to work with Neon without switching between tools.

# Wrapping up

The MCP ecosystem is becoming an important part of how developers connect tools, data, and AI systems. Servers expose useful capabilities, and clients make those capabilities accessible within the environments developers already use.

Appwrite has added two servers that fit naturally into this ecosystem. [MCP server for Appwrite **API**](/docs/tooling/mcp/api) lets AI tools interact with Appwrite projects to create users, manage databases, and handle resources through simple prompts. The [MCP server for Appwrite docs](/docs/tooling/mcp/docs) complements it by allowing clients to access Appwrite’s documentation contextually, so information and references are always within reach.
