Bringing messaging into your app — emails, push notifications, or SMS — gives your users a direct line to you. It lets you instantly share updates, reminders, special offers, or important info right when your users need it, keeping them engaged. But which messaging provider do you choose, and how do you integrate it?

In this article, we cover the benefits of multiple messaging providers to help you choose the best one for your use case. We will also guide you through integrating Twilio, SendGrid, APNs, and FCM into your app using Appwrite.

# Prerequisites

Before we begin, you must sign up for [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/register) and create a project if you haven’t already. Signing up is free and should only take a few minutes.

# Twilio

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that offers SMS, voice, video, and email services. It's known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration. As part of its comprehensive communication tools, Twilio also provides a robust push notification service.

**Benefits of using Twilio:**

-   **Cross-platform messaging**: Send push notifications to both iOS and Android devices easily.
-   **Personalization and segmentation**: Customize messages for targeted communication.

# How to integrate Twilio into your app

Integrating Twilio into your app is fairly simple. For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll focus on the SMS functionality.

## Step 1. Set up a Twilio account

Create a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and purchase a phone number that supports SMS. Go to **Account info** and save your **Account SID** and **Account Token**, which you will need for the next step.

## Step 2: Add Twilio provider to your Appwrite project

In your Appwrite project, navigate to **Messaging** > **Providers** > **Create a provider** > **SMS**. Name your provider and select **Twilio**. On the next page, fill out the **Account SID** and **Account Token**, as well as the phone number that will be sending SMS.

Once you complete provider creation, you should see it on your list of providers. You can now use this number to send SMS to your users!

## Step 3: Test the provider

In your **Messaging** tab, you can now create a new message. Pick your users ([set up an SMS authentication flow to get users’ phone numbers if you haven’t yet](/docs/products/auth/phone-sms)), set your target and topic and choose the time. That’s it — now your users will receive an SMS.

Follow these simple steps to integrate SendGrid into your Appwrite project.

## Step 1: Sign up on SendGrid

First, [sign up for a SendGrid account](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) and complete the setup. Then, [create an API key](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys) with full access and save it for future use. Next, follow SendGrid's [Domain Authentication](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication) guide to authenticate your domain. If you don’t have a domain, use their [Single Sender Verification](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/sending-email/sender-verification) process to verify your sender identity.

## Step 2: Add SendGrid provider to your Appwrite project

In your Appwrite project, go to **Messaging** > **Providers** > **Create a provider** > **Email.** Name your provider and choose SendGrid. In the next page, you get to enter the API Key, the email address and customize the sender name, reply-to email and name.

## Step 3: Test the SendGrid provider

Make sure you have at least one [topic](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging/topics) or [target](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging/targets) set up before testing.

Once the provider is configured, head to **Messages** > **Create an email message**. Enter the text, choose the recipients, and set the delivery time for your message. That’s it — you can now send emails to your users!

Head to your new Apple Developer account and save the following details:

| Field name                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundle ID                     | Head to Apple Developer account > Program resources > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Identifiers                                                                                                       |
| Team ID                       | Head to Apple Developer account > Membership details > Team ID                                                                                                                                                 |
| Authentication key (.p8 file) | Head to Apple Developer account > Program resources > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Keys. Create a key and give it a name. Enable the Apple Push Notifications service (APNS), and register your key. |
| Authentication key ID         | Head to Apple Developer account > Program resources > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Keys. Click on your key to view details.                                                                          |

## Step 2: Add APNs provider to your Appwrite project

In your Appwrite project, go to **Messaging** > **Providers** > **Create a new push notifications provider**.

Enter the **team ID**, **bundle ID**, **authentication key ID**, and the **authentication key (.p8 file)** you got from the Apple Developer Member Center. If your app uses a development provisioning profile, enable Sandbox mode.

## Step 3: Test the provider

To test the provider on your Apple devices, you'll need to make some additional settings in Xcode. Open your app in **Xcode** > **Signing & Capabilities** > **Capabilities** > **Push Notifications**, and turn it on.

Next, follow the [Send push notifications](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging/send-push-notifications) guide to test your setup. After that, you should be able to send Push notifications from **Messaging**.
