We remain dedicated to maintaining the highest information security standards for all industries.
Although we go beyond just meeting the requirements, Appwrite still commits to conform to the most stringent security standards
like [GDPR](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/security/gdpr), [HIPAA](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/security/hipaa), and [PCI](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/security/pci) to ensure the safety of your data.

Today, we are excited to add to Appwrite's list of security standards compliance and announce that Appwrite has achieved SOC 2 Type 1 compliance (System and Organization Controls). 

# What is SOC 2 Type 1?

SOC 2 Type 1 is a certification based on the auditing of a service organization's systems and the suitability of the design of its controls. It stands for "System and Organization Controls," and the "Type 1" designation specifically refers to an audit that assesses the design of security processes at a specific point in time. The criteria for this audit are set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ([AICPA](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/)).

The main focus of SOC 2 Type 1 is to evaluate how a company's controls align with the five trust service principles:

1. **Security**: The system is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical).
2. **Availability**: The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.
3. **Processing Integrity**: System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized.
4. **Confidentiality**: Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.
5. **Privacy**: Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of in conformity with the commitments in the entity's privacy notice.

# What this means for you

If you're using Appwrite to build your products, you should be excited about our compliance with SOC 2 Type 1. As a cloud provider that stores data, we have to be very sure about the safety of not only our users but also your users.

> The report generated from a SOC 2 Type 1 audit provides assurance to clients and stakeholders that the service provider has designed and implemented these controls effectively as of the audit date.

This assures you of data security of the highest standards for your products.

# What we did to attain compliance

So, what did we do to attain compliance with SOC 2 Type I? Just like with our [GDPR](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-appwrite-is-gdpr-compliant) and [HIPAA](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-appwrite-is-hipaa-compliant) compliance, we needed to undergo rigorous evaluations of internal policies, procedures, and infrastructure. We've implemented measures to safeguard user data, ensuring that our practices align with the stringent requirements of SOC 2 standards.

## Appwrite system description
