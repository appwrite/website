If you've been working with Appwrite, you've likely encountered the error message "Error: User (role: guests) missing scope (account)" at some point. This error is one of the most common questions we see from developers, especially those new to Appwrite. In this post, we'll break down what this error means and walk through the various scenarios where it might appear, along with their solutions.

# Understanding the error message

Before diving into specific scenarios, let's understand what the error message is telling us:

- **User (role: guests)**: This indicates that the request is coming from an unauthenticated user (a guest) rather than a logged-in user.
- **missing scope (account)**: This means the operation you're trying to perform requires access to an account.

In essence, this error occurs when you're trying to perform an operation that requires authentication, but Appwrite doesn't detect a valid authenticated session.

There are a handful of reasons you may be receiving this error, which we'll explore in detail below.

# No active session

The most common cause of this error is attempting to access user account information when there's no active session.

If you're not logged in yet and you try to get information about the user with something like `account.get()`, you'll see this error.

```js
// This will fail if no user is logged in
try {
  const user = await account.get();
  console.log(user);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // Error: User (role: guests) missing scope (account)
}
```

Note: This error is actually expected and useful in certain scenarios, such as when your app first starts and you need to check if a user is logged in. You can catch this error to determine that there's no active session and redirect users to a login page accordingly.

However, if you're getting this error when you actually need an authenticated session, here's how to resolve it:

```js
// First create a session
await account.createEmailSession('user@example.com', 'password');

// Now this will work
const user = await account.get();
console.log(user);
```

# OAuth2 sessions in web applications

A more complex scenario occurs when using OAuth2 authentication in web applications. When you use `account.createOAuth2Session()` in a web app, a cookie is set for the session.

If your app and Appwrite endpoint are on different domains (for example, your app is on `localhost:3000` and you're using `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1` as your Appwrite endpoint), the cookie may not be included in the `account.get()` request because the cookie is considered a 3rd party cookie.

There are two approaches to solve this issue:

## Option 1: Browser settings and custom domains

For local development:
- Allow 3rd party cookies in your browser settings
- Some browsers have specific development settings to allow cross-domain cookies during local development

For production:
- Configure a custom domain for your Appwrite project so that cookies are sent from the same domain as your application
- This ensures that session cookies are properly sent with each request


## Option 2: Use OAuth2 tokens

A more reliable approach is to use Appwrite's OAuth2 token-based authentication, which bypasses third-party cookie restrictions entirely. Instead of `createOAuth2Session()`, you would use `createOAuth2Token()` which implements a more privacy-friendly flow that works in all browsers.

For a detailed implementation guide, check out our article on [Fixing OAuth2 authentication issues in Appwrite Cloud](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/fixing-oauth2-issues-in-appwrite-cloud?doFollow=true), which covers this approach in depth.

# Creating sessions server side

In the browser, the Appwrite SDK automatically persists the session by using cookies. Server-side, however, different frameworks handle sessions differently so the session is not persisted.

Since `account.createEmailPasswordSession()` doesn't persist a session, calling `account.get()` right after will result in an unauthenticated request:

```js
// Server-side code - this approach doesn't work as expected
await account.createEmailPasswordSession('user@example.com', 'password');
// In a different request or function call:
const user = await account.get(); // Error: missing scope (account)
```

For server-side environments, you need to handle session persistence manually:

1. Use an API key when authenticating so that the response from Appwrite includes a secret you can use for subsequent requests
2. Store and reuse the session information between requests

When you create a session with `createEmailPasswordSession()`, Appwrite returns a session object that includes a `$id` and `secret`. You can use these values with the `setSession()` method to authenticate future requests.

# Conclusion

Whenever you see "User (role: guests) missing scope (account)", remember: Appwrite expected an authenticated user but received a guest request instead. This typically happens because:

1. No session exists yet
2. The session cookie is being blocked by browser privacy settings
3. Server-side code isn't properly managing session persistence

Each scenario has a straightforward solution as we've covered above. Test your authentication flow across multiple browsers and environments to ensure it works consistently.
