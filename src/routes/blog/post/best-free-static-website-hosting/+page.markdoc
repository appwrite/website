If you’ve ever built a static website, you know the feeling of getting it ready to go live and then asking yourself, “Where do I host this… without paying a dime?” The good news is that there are plenty of platforms today that let you publish static websites for free. Whether it’s a personal portfolio, a side project, or an MVP you’re testing, free static site hosting has become the default way to get started fast.

But with so many [hosting services](/products/sites) available, choosing the right one can get confusing. So instead of leaving you to dig through multiple docs and pricing pages, we put together this simple comparison of the 6 best free static hosting providers.

# FAQ

**1. What is the best open source alternative to Vercel?**

Appwrite Sites is a strong open source alternative to Vercel. Unlike most static site hosts, it combines static and [server-side rendering](/docs/products/sites/rendering/ssr) with built-in backend services such as [authentication](/docs/products/auth), [databases](/docs/products/databases), and serverless functions. This makes it ideal for developers who want more control without vendor lock-in.

**2. Can I host a static website with a secure custom domain using Appwrite?**

Yes. Appwrite Sites supports [custom domains](/docs/products/sites/domains) with free SSL certificates. You can deploy your static or SSR site and serve it securely over HTTPS, all managed through the Appwrite dashboard.

**3. Does Appwrite offer enterprise support plans?**

Yes. Appwrite provides enterprise-grade support, including SLAs, [security](/docs/advanced/security) compliance, and dedicated assistance for larger teams and organizations building critical applications.

**4. What makes Appwrite different from Firebase or Netlify?**

While Firebase and Netlify focus either on backend services or frontend hosting, Appwrite combines both. You get static site hosting, server-side rendering, databases, authentication, storage, and functions in one open source platform.

**5. Can I deploy a React app with backend services in Appwrite?**

Absolutely. You can deploy your [React frontend](/docs/products/sites/quick-start/react) with Appwrite Sites and connect it directly to Appwrite’s backend services, such as database, authentication, and storage. This gives you a full-stack setup without relying on multiple providers.

**6. How does Appwrite compare to Render, Netlify, and Vercel?**

Render and Netlify provide solid **free static site hosting**, while Vercel is optimized for frontend frameworks like Next.js. Appwrite Sites goes further by combining hosting with backend services, making it more versatile for teams building full-stack applications.

**7. Can I use GitHub Actions to deploy to Appwrite Sites?**

Not directly. While Appwrite integrates with GitHub repositories for [automatic deployments](/docs/products/sites), GitHub Actions do not work with Sites out of the box today. Instead, you can connect your GitHub repo directly in the Appwrite console, and every push will trigger a deployment automatically. This gives you the benefits of continuous deployment without having to manually configure GitHub Actions.

**8. Does Appwrite Sites support preview deployments like Vercel and Netlify?**

Yes. Appwrite Sites offers [preview deployments](/docs/products/sites/previews) for every pull request or branch. This means that whenever you push a new feature or bug fix, Appwrite automatically creates a live preview URL. Your team can test the changes in a production-like environment before merging, making collaboration faster and safer.
