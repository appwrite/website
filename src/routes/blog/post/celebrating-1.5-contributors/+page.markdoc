For those of you who have been following Appwrite, you might have noticed how much we value open source and the community that keeps it going. Appwrite has been a part of that community since 2019. However, the team has been contributing to open source long before Appwrite became an entity. If one thing in life is certain, it is that Appwrite is open-source.

# What does open source mean to Appwrite?

What does it actually mean to be open source as a company? It means that our code is open for other developers to use, copy, and fork, but most importantly, to contribute to. It's about being transparent and about building in the open; it is about giving back to those who helped us get here. Most of Appwrite’s engineers were community members before they joined. To us, this embodies an important mindset that instates open source into the core of Appwrite. It is the foundation we build on and will always be at the heart of everything we do. With over 800+ contributors contributing to Appwrite, it's fair enough to say that the Appwrite you see today was built by you, the open-source community. Our latest release, Appwrite 1.5, was no exception to the same

# Introducing Appwrite 1.5

If you haven’t yet heard, Appwrite recently announced the release of version 1.5, which has brought with it numerous features and upgrades, starting with Appwrite Messaging, our new offering to simplify implementing communication and messaging services in your applications. We have also released support for Server-Side Rendering frameworks in our SDK, allowing a substantial amount of web developers in our community to build with a lot more ease. Additionally, we have introduced Two-Factor Authentication in our suite of authentication offerings to improve the security of your app’s users. We have also added support for Enums in our SDKs to improve the developer experience and added new Bun and Dart function runtimes to Appwrite Cloud, among other updates and changes.

You can learn more about the release by visiting the [Init website](/init).

# Contributors’ highlight

All of our contributors are very special to us, for they make Appwrite what it is. With this release, we also wanted to highlight some contributors whose stories inspired us:

- [Bishwajeet Parhi](https://github.com/2002Bishwajeet)

Bishwajeet has been an active contributor to the Appwrite community for the last 2+ years and was chosen among the inaugural batch of the Appwrite Heroes. One of the features he contributed to in Appwrite 1.5 was the addition of Enums in the Appwrite SDKs to simplify the experience of working with constants, such as the names of different providers.

Here’s how Bishwajeet felt about his experience contributing to Appwrite SDK Generator:

> “I recently contributed to adding support for enums in the Appwrite repositories. The contributing guides helped me a lot in setting up Appwrite and the SDK Generator locally. It took me a while to get a hold of the codebase and understand where to add new changes. Jake helped me navigate the codebase a lot and pointed me to what to do and how to test it. Once the PR was up, I had multiple reviews involving Eldad, Jake, and Damodar. Everyone was supportive and helpful, and after a bunch of reviews, the PR was finally merged. I can proudly say that now I can code in multiple languages.”

- [Utkarsh Ahuja](https://github.com/UtkarshAhuja2003)

Utkarsh is an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. In Appwrite 1.5, he took the opportunity to make his first-ever feature contribution to Appwrite, which happens to be a new OAuth adapter for Zoho.

Learn how Utkarsh felt about his experience proposing and contributing his first feature:

> “Contributing to Appwrite's codebase was a great learning experience. The team's guidance on pull requests, OAuth Adapter tutorials, and Gitpod integration made development efficient.”

- [Ben Humphries](https://github.com/iMacHumphries)

Ben Humphries is a member of Appwrite’s GitHub community and an active open-source developer. He helped solve a build timeout issue with Appwrite Functions for slower building runtimes like Swift.

Hear how Ben felt about his experience collaborating with his fellow Appwrite community members:

> “Contributing to Appwrite has been a rewarding experience. The community’s support and collaboration have been exceptional, making it easy to share ideas and feel like part of the team. The highlight for me was playing a small part in making it easier to use Swift on the server side.”
