If you are looking to build a mobile app, website, tool, or any other application that needs a backend, then you also know the daunting tasks that await. This is probably what brought you to this blog in the first place: looking for a solution to take care of your backend. One of these solutions is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). It provides pre-built backend infrastructure and services to simplify app development, handling server-side tasks like data storage, user management, APIs, server maintenance, security, database management, and more. Two of these solutions are Appwrite and Supabase, and although both are solid options for your BaaS, they’re somewhat different.

This article will give you a rundown of Appwrite and Supabase to understand the feature sets. Then, we’ll provide a quick Appwrite vs Supabase comparison so you can understand how each provider will fit your specific needs.

# Appwrite

In 2019, [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) started as an open-source project to make software development more accessible and enjoyable. It is a Backend as a Service platform with a vibrant developer community. You can self-host Appwrite on your server or utilize [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/). Appwrite provides a wide range of features, including user authentication, databases, storage, real-time features, and functions. It is known for its flexibility, security, and extensibility, enabling you to implement custom backend logic and build applications tailored to your needs. 

# Supabase

Supabase positions itself as an alternative to Firebase, which offers a range of tools and services for developing and deploying web and mobile apps. It was founded in 2020 and aims to be a user-friendly, scalable, and secure platform for creating modern applications. Supabase provides features for user authentication, app analytics, databases, real-time, and functions. It supports various platforms such as web, Android, and iOS and can be easily integrated with other tools and services. You can use their Cloud platform or self-host.

# Features compared

When looking into a BaaS solution, it is good to understand how the products and features can serve your project’s needs. We compiled a list of similarities and differences between Appwrite and Supabase for you to understand both offerings better.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity to ensure that only the appropriate individuals have access to their private data. Different authentication methods include email and passwords, passwordless login via emails and phone numbers, or applications that offer single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. It is usually the initial step in application development for developers. BaaS platforms simplify this process by offering SDKs and APIs.

*Similarities***:**

- Both offer robust authentication capabilities, including user registration, login, and passwordless login options.
- They both support various authentication methods, such as email and password, social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.), and device authentication.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is available to manage user permissions and restrict access to resources.

*Differences***:**

- Appwrite provides more granular user management features, such as user groups, metadata, and custom claims.
- Supabase offers integration with LDAP and SAML for enterprise environments.

## Databases

A database is an organized collection of information stored in a way that allows for easy access, retrieval, management, and updating. Databases store and manage large volumes of structured data, supporting activities such as data storage, analysis, and management. They are integral to any application.

Both Appwrite and Supbase provide databases that can be used depending on the needs of your project.

*Similarities***:**

- Both provide a user-friendly database interface for creating and managing tables, indexes, and relationships.
- They both support relational databases.
- Schema migrations are available to manage database changes in a structured manner.

*Differences***:**

- Appwrite offers an abstraction layer above MariaDB as part of its API, offering a simpler developer experience for data consumption and user permissions management.
- Appwrite offers simple-to-use offset and cursor pagination out-of-the-box to developers.
- Supabase's PostgreSQL database is more suited for complex relational data queries and joins, however, it increases the learning curve substantially.

## Storage

Storage allows you to manage files in your project. It can store images, videos, documents, and other project files. Storage can be a crucial requirement for any application that operates on binary data (e.g., social media platforms), and here's what Appwrite and Supbase have to offer:

*Similarities***:**

- Both provide object storage for storing and managing files, images, and other binary data.
- Access control is available to manage files and restrict access.

*Differences***:**

- Appwrite offers file previews and thumbnails to enhance user experience, as well as an image manipulation API in the free tier.
- Supabase supports storing files in different storage tiers.

## Functions

Functions are "self-contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. BaaS platforms make it easier for you to extend the services by using functions with code snippets.

*Similarities:*

- Both Appwrite and Supabase provide serverless functions for executing code on demand.
- They both offer triggers to execute functions on events, such as file uploads or database changes.

*Differences:*

- Appwrite supports 10+ programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Dart, whereas Supabase only supports one programming language, TypeScript.
- Appwrite’s functions runtimes have been developed in-house, enabling a more curated developer experience and the ability to develop runtimes more quickly, whereas Supabase uses a 3rd party offering, limiting the pace of development and control over experience.
- Appwrite offers a marketplace of function templates that are ready to deploy with a few button clicks, which Supabase does not offer.

## Realtime

Real-time, by definition, means "without significant delay.” You can use it to get constant updates on any activities that occur within the application you are building. This can be applied in various ways, such as a chat application. While real-time features can be complex to build, you can use Appwrite and Supabase to achieve them quickly.

*Similarities:*

- Appwrite and Supabase provide real-time data synchronization using WebSockets.
- Both of them support broadcasting changes to large audiences.
- They both offer client libraries for various programming languages.

*Differences:*

- Supabase supports real-time updates for database changes only, whereas Appwrite also supports updates in other products (e.g., function executions).

## Messaging

Messaging allows you to implement communications in your application. You can use this to send information and updates directly to users through various methods, such as push notifications, SMS, and email. Currently, Supabase has no direct messaging features, whereas Appwrite does.

*Similarities:*

- You can use real-time features along with databases in both Appwrite and Supabase to create a chat application.
- You can use functions in both Appwrite and Supabase to use external providers for SMS and email.

*Differences:*

- Appwrite Messaging features 10 different providers to leverage major communications providers for SMSes, emails, and push notifications. It offers user segregation, message scheduling, and message previews as well. Supabase offers none of these.

## Support

Any developer-first product, regardless of how good and simple it may be, will need a system for support in case its consumers face any issues. Both Appwrite and Supabase have developed support offerings to ensure their consumers are able to share feedback and get the necessary help. 

*Similarities***:**

- Both Appwrite and Supabase offer comprehensive documentation and community forums for self-help.
- They both provide paid support plans for priority email assistance.
- They both have active open-source communities where users can collaborate and share knowledge.

*Differences***:**

- The Appwrite community is very active and provides fast and comprehensive support.
- Supabase provides a higher tier of support for a higher price.
