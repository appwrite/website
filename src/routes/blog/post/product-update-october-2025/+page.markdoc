Welcome back to the October product update. This month, we released the most requested Database feature, along with Appwrite 1.8x support for Self-hosted. Best of all, you can now spin up unlimited Sites on the free plan.

So, here's what to expect:

- Transactions API
- New cloud regions
- TanStack Start support
- Next.js 16 support

Let's dive in.

# Unlimited Sites on the Free plan

Appwrite Sites began in early access with a single goal: to make deploying modern web projects as seamless as building them. To ensure performance and reliability, we initially limited deployments to one site per project while we refined the experience.

Now that the platform has matured, that limit's gone. With the Free plan, you can now deploy an unlimited number of sites per project, giving you the freedom to build, test, and launch without constraints.

![Transactions API](/images/blog/product-update-october-2025/transactions.png)

# Transactions API

This was one of the most requested features by the community, and it's finally live on both Appwrite Cloud and Self-hosted instances.

With Transactions API, you can stage multiple operations across one or more tables, and commit them only when you're ready.

- If every operation checks out, Appwrite commits them in one atomic action.
- If anything fails, whether due to permissions, conflicts, validations, or other reasons, Appwrite automatically rolls everything back.

# 1.8 Self-hosted support

Appwrite 1.8 is now live for Self-hosted instances.

Appwrite has always been built with openness and flexibility in mind. Every release we ship is meant to work just as well for teams running their own infrastructure as it does on the cloud.

Version 1.8 continues that commitment, giving self-hosted users access to:

- New Databases experience
- Powerful Databases features
- Features to simplify and streamline migrations

![TanStack Start](/images/blog/product-update-october-2025/tanstack.png)

# TanStack Start support for Appwrite Sites

TanStack Start is making all the noise, and for good reason. It's simple, type-safe, and built for devs who want control.

You can now run TanStack Start with full Server-Side Rendering (SSR) directly on Appwrite Cloud. Zero configuration needed.

![New cloud](/images/blog/product-update-october-2025/cloud.png)

# New Cloud regions

We've added two new regions to Appwrite Cloud. The Singapore (SGP) and Toronto (TOR) Cloud regions are now live and ready for your projects.

This means you can:

- Create new projects directly.
- Or migrate your existing projects to take advantage of the new locations.

# Next.js 16 SSR support

Next.js 16 brings one of the most polished releases the framework has seen in a while. Instead of chasing big rewrites, this version focuses on the fundamentals, faster builds, predictable caching, smarter routing, and better developer visibility.

And if you're deploying on Appwrite Sites, you can start using Next.js 16. The latest release is fully supported, so you can build, test, and host your Next.js projects seamlessly on Appwrite's open-source infrastructure.
