This week, we announced the brand new 1.6 version, which features major updates to the Functions ecosystem, including local development, an updated CLI, support for Go, and more. And, just like every major release before that, Appwrite 1.6 is a testament to the power of open-source collaboration. With over 40 developers contributing, we've been able to push for a faster, better, smoother product for everyone in the community.

We're incredibly grateful for the dedication and hard work of our community. Every contribution, big or small, has made a significant impact. 

Therefore, we’d like to conclude Init by celebrating the people who made 1.6 possible — our open-source contributors. Thank you for helping us build a better Appwrite.
