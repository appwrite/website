React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building dynamic, interactive web applications. While deploying React apps is generally straightforward, choosing the right hosting platform that balances cost, performance, and developer-friendly features can be a challenge.

[Appwrite Sites](/products/sites) provides an optimized hosting environment tailored for modern web applications, including React, with built-in features that enhance performance, security, and deployment workflows. This article explores how Appwrite Sites simplifies React deployment, improves efficiency, and compares with other hosting solutions.

# Why Appwrite Sites is an excellent choice for React developers

## 1. Free hosting with no upfront costs

For developers and small teams, minimizing hosting expenses is essential. Appwrite Sites offers free hosting, removing financial barriers while ensuring a robust infrastructure. As projects grow, Appwrite provides an easy upgrade path to accommodate increased demands.

## 2. Optimized for static and dynamic React apps

React applications can be built as fully static sites or dynamically rendered apps using frameworks like Next.js. Appwrite Sites supports both approaches, allowing static exports to leverage global caching while enabling server-side functionality through **Appwrite Functions**, making it easy to add API endpoints or dynamic content generation.

## 3. Performance-focused global CDN

Application speed significantly impacts user experience and SEO. Appwrite Sites leverages a globally distributed [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/docs/products/network/cdn) to ensure React apps load quickly, reduce latency, and deliver a smooth browsing experience worldwide.

## 4. Built-in security and DDoS protection

Security is a crucial consideration for production applications. Appwrite Sites includes [DDoS protection](/docs/products/network/ddos), preventing attacks that could compromise your app's availability. Additionally, it offers **custom domain support with automatic SSL encryption**, ensuring secure communication with users.

## 5. Preview deployments for seamless collaboration

Every deployment on Appwrite Sites generates a **preview link**, making it easy to share, review, and test changes before pushing them to production. This workflow simplifies collaboration and enhances the quality assurance process.

## 6. Multiple deployment options

Appwrite Sites provides several flexible methods for deploying React applications:

- [Git-based deployments](/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git): Automatically deploy updates when changes are pushed to the main branch.
- **CLI-based deployment**: Deploy manually with a simple command:
    
    ```bash
    appwrite deploy site
    ```
    
- **Manual file uploads**: Upload static assets directly via the Appwrite Console.

Additionally, Appwrite provides **starter templates** and example projects to help developers get up and running with minimal setup.

## 7. Integrated backend services for full-stack React applications

Many React applications require authentication, databases, and serverless functions. Appwrite Sites seamlessly integrates with **Appwrite Auth**, **Appwrite Databases**, and **Appwrite Functions**, enabling developers to build full-stack applications without relying on third-party services.
