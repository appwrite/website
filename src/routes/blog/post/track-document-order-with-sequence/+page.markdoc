Some systems need to reflect the order in which actions happen. A ticketing system, for example, should assign "Ticket #41" before "Ticket #42". But in a user interface, it often makes sense to display the latest tickets first, so "Ticket #42" may appear above #41.

Relying on timestamps to get this right is often not enough. Two documents can be created almost simultaneously, and the sort order might vary. What is needed is a consistent, backend-assigned number that increases with each insert and cannot be modified or skipped.

Appwrite's new `$sequence` attribute provides exactly this. Every time a document is added to a collection, the system assigns it a unique, auto-incrementing integer. This value reflects the insert history of the collection and can be used for sorting, display, filtering, and pagination.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple web-based support ticket tracker using plain HTML and JavaScript. Each submitted ticket will be stored in Appwrite with a title and description, and each will receive a `$sequence` number automatically. We will use that number to display and order the tickets.

{% section #step-1 step=1 title="Set up your Appwrite project" %}

Start by opening the [Appwrite console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/). If you do not have a project yet, create one now.

## Create a new project

Give it a name like **Support Tracker**. After creation, note the **Project ID**, as you will need it later in your frontend code.

## Create a database and collection

Inside your project:

- Go to the **Database** section
- Create a new database named "Support DB"
- Inside that database, create a new collection named "Tickets"

## Add document attributes

In the **Tickets** collection, define the following attributes:

- `title` - type: `string`, required: `yes`, size: 256
- `body` - type: `string`, required: `yes`, size: 1000

Appwrite will automatically include system attributes such as `$id` and `$sequence`. You do not need to create `$sequence` manually.

Confirm the schema once all attributes are added.

## Set permissions for testing

For now, allow anyone to create and read documents:

- In the collection's **Settings**, under **Permissions**
- Add `role:any` to **Create** and **Read**

You can change this later when adding [authentication](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth).

Also take note of your **Database ID** and **Collection ID**. You will use them in your frontend.

## Configure web platform

To avoid CORS errors when testing your application, you need to add your domain to the allowed platforms:

- In your project **Overview**, under **Integrations**, go to the **Platforms** tab
- Click **Add Platform**
- Select **Web**
- In the web platform type, select **JavaScript**
- For hostname, add your domain or `localhost`, depending on your development environment. If running with something like VS Code Live Server, add `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or whatever port you're using)
- Click **Create Platform**

This tells Appwrite to allow requests from your domain or local development environment.

{% /section %}

{% section #step-2 step=2 title="Create the frontend structure" %}

In your project directory, create two files:

- `index.html`
- `script.js`

You can open them in any code editor. We'll build the interface in `index.html` and put all the JavaScript logic into `script.js`.

## Set up the HTML structure

Start with a clean HTML layout. In `index.html`, first add the document structure and dependencies:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Support Tracker</title>
    <script src="<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appwrite@17.0.0>"></script>
    <!-- Appwrite Pink Design System -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<https://unpkg.com/@appwrite.io/pink>" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<https://unpkg.com/@appwrite.io/pink-icons>" />
  </head>
  <body class="u-bg-color-neutral-5">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="u-max-width-700 u-margin-inline-auto u-padding-32"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```

This sets up the basic HTML structure and includes the Appwrite SDK and [Pink design system](https://pink.appwrite.io/) for styling.

Next, add the ticket submission form inside the container:

```html
<!-- New Ticket Form -->
<section class="u-margin-block-end-32">
  <h2 class="heading-level-3 u-margin-block-end-24 u-color-text-accent">
    Create New Ticket
  </h2>

  <div class="card u-padding-24 u-border-width-1 u-border-color-primary">
    <form id="ticket-form" class="u-flex u-flex-vertical u-gap-16">
      <div class="input-text-wrapper is-with-end-button">
        <label class="label u-margin-block-end-8">
          <span class="text u-color-text-accent">Ticket Subject</span>
        </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="title"
          class="input-text"
          placeholder="Brief description of your issue"
          required
        />
      </div>

      <div class="input-text-wrapper">
        <label class="label u-margin-block-end-8">
          <span class="text u-color-text-accent">Issue Description</span>
        </label>
        <textarea
          id="body"
          class="input-text"
          placeholder="Please provide detailed information about your issue..."
          rows="4"
          required
        ></textarea>
      </div>

      <div class="u-flex u-main-end">
        <button type="submit" class="button is-primary is-big">
          <span class="icon-send" aria-hidden="true"></span>
          <span class="text">Submit Ticket</span>
        </button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </div>
</section>

```

This form captures the ticket title and description. Note the `id` attributes on the form and inputs. We'll use these in our JavaScript.

Finally, add the tickets display section and close the document:

```html
        <!-- Tickets List -->
        <section>
          <div
            class="u-flex u-cross-center u-main-space-between u-margin-block-end-24"
          >
            <h2 class="heading-level-3 u-color-text-accent">Tickets</h2>
            <div class="tag u-color-text-info">
              <span class="icon-list" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              <span class="text" id="ticket-count">0 tickets</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div id="ticket-list" class="u-flex u-flex-vertical u-gap-16"></div>

          <div
            id="empty-state"
            class="u-text-center u-padding-48 u-color-text-neutral-100"
            style="display: none"
          >
            <span
              class="icon-inbox"
              style="font-size: 3rem; opacity: 0.5"
            ></span>
            <p class="body-text-1 u-margin-block-start-16">
              No tickets yet. Create your first support request above.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```

This page includes a form to submit a ticket and a container to display submitted tickets. The Appwrite SDK is loaded from a CDN, and the logic will live in `script.js`.

{% /section %}

{% section #step-3 step=3 title="Connect to Appwrite from JavaScript" %}

Now open `script.js`. You will begin by initializing the Appwrite client and pointing it to your project.

Paste the following into `script.js`:

```javascript
const client = new Appwrite.Client()

client
  .setEndpoint('<YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT>')
  .setProject('<YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID>')

const databases = new Appwrite.Databases(client)

const databaseId = '<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>'
const collectionId = '<YOUR_COLLECTION_ID>'

```

Replace the placeholders with your actual values from the Appwrite console.

This code sets up the SDK so that you can call `databases.createDocument()` and `databases.listDocuments()` in the rest of the script.

{% /section %}

{% section #step-4 step=4 title="Handle ticket submission" %}

Add logic to read the form data and send it to Appwrite. Still inside `script.js`, add this:

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById('ticket-form')

form.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()

  const title = document.getElementById('title').value.trim()
  const body = document.getElementById('body').value.trim()

  if (!title || !body) return

  try {
    await databases.createDocument({
      databaseId,
      collectionId,
      documentId: 'unique()',
      data: {
        title,
        body,
      }
    })

    form.reset()
    loadTickets()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
})

```

This code creates a new document in your collection when the form is submitted. It uses `'unique()'` to generate a unique ID. After submission, the form is reset and the list of tickets is reloaded to show the new entry.

{% /section %}

{% section #step-5 step=5 title="Load and display tickets using $sequence" %}

Now add a function that retrieves tickets and shows them in order, newest first:

```javascript
async function loadTickets() {
  try {
    const response = await databases.listDocuments({
      databaseId,
      collectionId,
      queries: [
        Appwrite.Query.orderDesc('$sequence'),
      ]
    })
    const ticketList = document.getElementById('ticket-list')
    const ticketCount = document.getElementById('ticket-count')
    const emptyState = document.getElementById('empty-state')

    ticketList.innerHTML = ''

    if (response.documents.length === 0) {
      emptyState.style.display = 'block'
      ticketCount.textContent = '0 tickets'
    } else {
      emptyState.style.display = 'none'
      ticketCount.textContent = `${response.documents.length} ticket${
        response.documents.length === 1 ? '' : 's'
      }`

      response.documents.forEach((ticket, index) => {
        const ticketElement = document.createElement('div')
        ticketElement.className = 'card u-padding-24'
        ticketElement.innerHTML = `
          <div class="tag is-color-primary u-margin-block-end-12">
            #${String(ticket.$sequence).padStart(3, '0')}
          </div>
          <h3 class="heading-level-6 u-margin-block-end-8">${ticket.title}</h3>
          <p class="body-text-2">${ticket.body}</p>
        `
        ticketList.appendChild(ticketElement)
      })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}

loadTickets()
```

This function does several things:

- Queries tickets sorted by `$sequence` in descending order (newest first)
- Updates the ticket counter to show the current number of tickets
- Shows or hides the empty state message appropriately
- Displays each ticket as a styled card with a formatted sequence number (e.g., #001, #042)
- Uses proper typography classes from the Pink design system
- Calls itself immediately to load tickets when the page first loads

The `padStart(3, '0')` method formats the sequence number with leading zeros.

## What you have built

You now have a working support ticket tracker that looks like this:

![Support tracker demo](/images/blog/track-document-order-with-sequence/support-tracker-demo.png)

- Each submitted ticket is stored as a document in Appwrite
- Every document receives a `$sequence` number, guaranteed to be unique and increasing
- The interface displays each ticket using that number
- The ticket list is reliably sorted by creation order

There was no need to write any logic to generate numbers, track counters, or manage collisions. Appwrite's `$sequence` attribute handled the sequence internally, which was great for our use case.

## Conclusion

This tutorial introduced the auto-incrementing `$sequence` attribute and demonstrated how to use it in a small, working app. It offers a solution to a common need: preserving the order of inserts in a predictable, integer-based way.

Because the value is assigned by your database, `$sequence` remains stable even as your application grows. You can filter by it, paginate through it, or display it directly in user interfaces. And since it is read-only and immutable, we avoid the risk of errors that often come with custom counters or timestamp sorting.

This pattern can extend far beyond tickets. You can use `$sequence` for invoices, order numbers, log entries, approval requests, or anything where sequence matters.

Here's a link to the GitHub repository for this tutorial: [Simple Support Tracker](https://github.com/appwrite-community/simple-support-tracker).

Looking forward to seeing what you build with this!
