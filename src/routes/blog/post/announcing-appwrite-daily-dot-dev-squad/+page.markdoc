We already share all of our blogs on the [daily.dev](http://daily.dev) platform, and now we also have a moderated Squad. This will make it easier for you to engage with our content and also share your content with the community.

# What is daily.dev?

For those who might not be familiar with it, daily.dev is a platform that curates the latest news, articles, and resources for developers. It's a go-to place to stay updated with what's happening in the world of development, from the latest frameworks and libraries to best practices and industry trends.

# What is a Squad?

A Squad is a specialized group within daily.dev, where you can share knowledge, ask questions, and discuss topics that matter most to you. Think of it as an online group tailored specifically for developers. Squads can be centered around your team, a specific project, a community, or any topic you're passionate about. It's a space to learn, collaborate, and have fun.
