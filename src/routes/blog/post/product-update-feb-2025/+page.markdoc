# Appwrite 1.6.1 is now available

We released Appwrite 1.6.1, packed with features, fixes and improvements to your Appwrite self-hosted instance.

Some of the notable updates include:

- Improved compatibility for webp requests.
- Additional function runtime versions such as Node 22, Dart 3.5, and Bun 1.1.
- A real-time heartbeat to keep real-time connections alive.

These updates focus on performance, stability, and expanded functionality.

# Usage metrics system improvements

We’ve improved the usage metric system to include OPTIONS requests and 4XX responses, which were previously omitted.

So now you can have a clearer traffic overview, making it easy to track requests, identify issues, and optimize performance.
