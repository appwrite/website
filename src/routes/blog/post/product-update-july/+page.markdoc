July was packed with announcements and new content. We announced Appwrite integrations, started a [daily dev](http://daily.dev) Squad, and created a bunch of coding tutorials for you. Let’s get straight into it!

# Integrations Catalog

We just launched our brand new Integrations Catalog — a one-stop-shop for all your Appwrite integrations needs. It’s designed to:

- Give you quick access to all Appwrite integrations
- Provide easy-to-follow implementation guides
- Store all integrations in one place with an intuitive design

The current integrations are just the first of many. We’ll be continually updating and adding more, so stay tuned!

A Squad is an easy way to keep up with all the cool things happening at Appwrite and get useful engineering resources in your daily digest. Plus, you can participate in discussions on tech trends and best practices with fellow Appwriters and share your knowledge and expertise.

# Community recognitions

This month, we’re excited to feature Daniel Veremchuk as part of our Monthly Community Recognitions.

Daniel developed the new Appwrite Hono Adapter for Bun as part of his Appwrite adapter repository. This adapter allows you to run your Hono application on Appwrite's **`bun-1.0+`** runtime.

[Take a look at the Bun adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gravlabs/appwrite-hono-adapter-bun). 

If you'd like to participate in next month's Community Recognitions, [join our Discord server](https://appwrite.io/discord) to showcase your project.

# Built with Appwrite

AyeHigh is a suite of user-friendly Gen AI tools designed to help improve resumes for students and young professionals. The developer, Raj Savaliya, leveraged Appwrite’s Auth, Storage and Databases to build the app’s backend faster. Here’s what he says about it:

> Fully able to focus on business logic without spending time on developing backend, auth, storage and all that stuff from scratch. Saved a lot of time and shipped faster.
> 

AyeHigh was also recently featured on ProductHunt. [Check them out here](https://www.producthunt.com/products/ayehigh#ayehigh).
