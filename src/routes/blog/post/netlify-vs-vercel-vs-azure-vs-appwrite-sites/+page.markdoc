Static site hosting has come a long way from just serving HTML files on a basic server. Today, platforms like **Vercel, Netlify, Azure Static Web Apps, and Appwrite Sites** make it possible to push code from a Git repo and have a live site up in seconds.

But with more choice comes more confusion. Developers often find themselves asking:

- “Should I go with Vercel or Netlify?”
- “Is Azure a good option for static sites?”
- “Are there open-source alternatives that give me more control?”

Each platform has its own philosophy. Vercel doubles down on Next.js, Netlify pioneered the JAMstack movement, Azure caters to enterprise teams, and Appwrite Sites adds an open-source spin with backend services included.

In this blog, we’ll look at all four side by side: what they offer, how much they cost, and the trade-offs you’ll want to keep in mind before choosing your stack.

# What is static hosting and why does it matter

Static hosting has become the default for modern web projects. Instead of managing heavy servers or complex configurations, you can simply deploy HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a global CDN and let users access them instantly. 

# Benefits of static hosting

- Speed by default: Static sites are served directly from a global CDN, so your content is cached close to the user. That’s why a **Netlify static site** or a **Vercel app** often feels blazing fast without extra optimization.
    
- Simplicity: You don’t need to manage servers, runtime environments, or scaling policies. Deployment is often as easy as connecting a Git repo.
    
- Scalability: Whether you’re serving 10 users or 10 million, static hosting scales effortlessly since files are distributed globally. 
    
- Lower costs: Serving static files is cheap compared to dynamic servers. Even with added edge functions or APIs, costs are predictable. With platforms like **Appwrite Sites**, where hosting, authentication, databases, and storage come together in one place, you save money by avoiding the need for multiple separate services.
    
- Security: There are no databases or servers exposed by default, which means fewer attack vectors. For many developers, this is a big reason to switch from traditional hosting.
