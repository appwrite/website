At Appwrite, we're constantly evolving our products, features, and experience, and we understand it is challenging to keep up with these modifications. Therefore, we introduce the Changelog feed to our website. An easier way to be informed about releases, updates, and fixes. The new Changelog feed is our commitment to transparency and collaboration and a great tool to be easily in the loop with all the small or big changes in our products.

## What to expect from the new Changelog

The Changelog is how we keep you informed and show our continuous improvements. Here's what you can find in it:

**Concise updates**: Each entry is a quick-to-digest snippet, giving you the gist of the update without requiring extensive reading.

**Highlighted features**: Discover the most impactful changes with highlights that draw your attention to what matters most.

**Resources**: Whether it's an in-depth blog post or an informative YouTube video, we provide links to resources that delve deeper into the update.
