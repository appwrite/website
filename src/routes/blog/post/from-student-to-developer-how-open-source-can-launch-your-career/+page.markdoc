You might still be a student, still learning, or still wondering where you belong in tech.  

You scroll through GitHub, see contributors building amazing things, and it feels like they are miles ahead.  

But here is the truth: **every great developer you admire once made their first pull request too.**  
And that first contribution was not their end point. It was their beginning.

# What Is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source.  
Each October, developers from all over the world make their first contributions, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new features to projects that anyone can use.  

For many, it is their first step into real-world collaboration.  
It is how they gain hands-on experience, connect with other developers, and start building the foundation of their careers.  

But whether you joined Hacktoberfest or contributed to an open source project on your own, the message is the same:  
**you have already started your journey.**

# This is the start of your story

Your first pull request, no matter how small, proves something powerful.  
You can collaborate, communicate, and contribute to something bigger than yourself.

My story started with open source back in 2011-2012, where I joined a community and helped out in different areas. This has led me to endless opportunities and helped me land jobs.

That is what open source really gives you:  
- Real-world teamwork in global, asynchronous environments  
- Peer reviews and mentorship from experienced engineers  
- Communication practice through documentation and issue discussions  
- A public record of your progress and growth  

Every contribution, even one, builds credibility. It is your foundation.

The practice of collaboration with global teams in open source helped me with personal growth and improved my communication skills that prepared me for professional careers. Without open source, I don't know where I'd be now.

# Quality > Quantity

As someone who has interviewed developers, I do not care how many PRs you have made. I care about *what they show.*  

One thoughtful, well-written contribution tells me:  
- You understand the project context  
- You respect guidelines and feedback  
- You collaborate professionally in reviews  
- You care about the craft of software  

AI tools can assist you, but your thought process, curiosity, and voice are what make your work stand out.  Don't get me wrong, AI is a HUGE help and can write better code than experienced engineers. But make sure you understand what it's doing.
**That is what employers notice.**

# Your GitHub is your portfolio

Do not just treat GitHub as a storage space. It is your portfolio.  
Curate it like one.  

Add open source work to your resume or LinkedIn profile.  
Be specific:  
> Improved database query efficiency by 30% through indexing optimization.

A clean, consistent GitHub profile says more about your skills than any list of buzzwords.  
Visibility matters. Your next opportunity might begin with someone reviewing your code.

# Learn and build in public

Share your journey online, not just your wins but what you learned.  
Even a simple post like:  
> I just merged my first pull request! Here is what I learned about React hooks.  

This is not self-promotion. It is reflection.  
It helps others who are starting out feel less alone, and it helps future employers see your growth mindset.

# Grow beyond code

Writing great code is important, but so is helping others write theirs.  
Try:  
- Reviewing pull requests from new contributors  
- Writing documentation or tutorials  
- Answering questions in community chats  

These are leadership skills in disguise.  
And the same qualities that make someone a great open source contributor, empathy, clarity, and initiative, make them a great teammate too.

# Keep going

Whether you joined Hacktoberfest or just submitted your first contribution this week, do not stop now.  

Your journey has already begun.  
Keep showing up. Keep learning. Keep building.  

Because open source is not just about code. It is about people, opportunity, and growth.  
And the next great creator, maintainer, or innovator might be **you.**
