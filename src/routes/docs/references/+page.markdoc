title: API reference
description: Here's a complete API reference for Appwrite SDK, REST, and GraphQL APIs. Learn how to use Authentication, Databases, Storage, and other Appwrite APIs.
---
Appwrite lets you build integrations on web, mobile, native, and server platforms through a set of APIs. You can use one of our many [SDKs](/docs/sdks) or integrate directly through the [REST API](/docs/apis/rest) or [GraphQL API](/docs/apis/graphql).

## Client vs Server APIs {% #client-vs-server %}

Client APIs and SDKs are for integrating with Appwrite to build client-based applications and websites.
Client APIs only give access to resources if users have been [granted permissions](/docs/advanced/platform/permissions).

Server API and SDKs are for integrating with Appwrite to build backend or server applications.
Server APIs are constrained by an [API key's](/docs/advanced/platform/api-keys) scope, ignoring user permissions.

## APIs {% #api %}
Before using the Appwrite APIs, in the **Settings** of your Appwrite project, obtain your **API endpoint** and **Project ID**.
Client APIs require an active session, created from [signing up and logging in](/docs/products/auth/accounts#signup-login).
Server APIs require [API keys](/docs/advanced/platform/api-keys).

## Error handling {% #error-handling %}

When building with Appwrite, implement proper error handling to provide user-friendly messages instead of exposing raw error responses. For implementation details and best practices, refer to our [Error handling guide](/docs/advanced/platform/error-handling) and [Response codes](/docs/advanced/platform/response-codes#error-types) documentation.
