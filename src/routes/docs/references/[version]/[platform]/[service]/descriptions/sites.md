The Sites service allows you to host, deploy and manage web applications directly within the Appwrite platform. You can use this service to create and manage sites, handle deployments, configure domains, and set up environment variables.

Sites supports both static and server-side rendered (SSR) websites. Static sites are pre-built and served as-is, while SSR sites generate content dynamically for each request. The service automatically handles SSL certificates, provides unique domains for each site, and allows custom domain configuration.

Each deployed site benefits from a global CDN with strategic edge locations as well as advanced security features offered by [Appwrite Network](/docs/products/network). Site deployments can be configured with custom environment variables, build settings, and timeouts. You can deploy sites manually or set up automatic deployments from Git repositories for continuous integration and delivery.

You can find more information on how to build and deploy a web app in the [Sites product pages](/docs/products/sites).
