The Teams service allows you to group users of your project and share [read and write](/docs/advanced/platform/permissions) access to resources like database rows or storage files.

Each user who creates a team becomes the team owner and can delegate the ownership role by inviting a new team member. Only team owners can invite new users to their team.
