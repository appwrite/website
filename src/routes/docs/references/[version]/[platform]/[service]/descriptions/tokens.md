The Tokens service allows you to create, manage, and validate file tokens for your storage files. These tokens provide a way to grant temporary, controlled access to files without requiring user authentication or exposing sensitive permissions.

File tokens are particularly useful when you need to share access to private storage files with unauthenticated users or services for a limited time period. Each token is linked to a specific file and can be configured with an expiry date to ensure access is only granted for the necessary duration.

You can use tokens to generate secure URLs to view, preview, or download files. The Tokens service provides endpoints to create, list, retrieve, update, and delete tokens, giving you complete control over file access management.

For more detailed information about using file tokens in your application, refer to the [File tokens documentation](/docs/products/storage/file-tokens).
