Coolify is an open-source, self-hosted platform that simplifies application deployment through an intuitive interface and automated workflows. With its one-click deployment feature, you can quickly deploy various services, including Appwrite's comprehensive backend solution. To explore the full range of supported services, visit the [Coolify Docs](https://coolify.io/docs/services/appwrite). This guide will walk you through setting up Appwrite on your Coolify instance and provide necessary troubleshooting tips.

# Prerequisites {% #prerequisites %}

Before starting, ensure your server meets the [minimum requirements](/docs/advanced/self-hosting#system-requirements) for hosting Appwrite with Coolify.

# Installation {% #installation %}

Install Coolify using the command below:

```bash
curl -sSL https://coolify.io/install | bash
```

Once the installation is complete, open the Coolify dashboard in your web browser.  

1. Click the **Create Project** button to start a new project.  
2. Select or create an environment type. By default, a **production** environment is already available.  
3. Click **Add new resource**.  
4. Search for and select **Appwrite** from the list of services.  

The configuration fields will be pre-filled with the recommended settings, but you can customize them. When ready, click the **Deploy** button to initiate the deployment process.

After deployment, access your Appwrite instance's console by clicking the console link in the **Links** section of the Appwrite service.

# Configuration {% #configuration %}

Coolify handles most configurations automatically. However, to enable additional features, you may need to configure some environment variables manually.

**Assistant**  
To generate code snippets and assist with documentation for your Appwrite project, set the `_APP_ASSISTANT_OPENAI_API_KEY` variable using your OpenAI API key.

**SMS Notifications**  
To enable SMS notifications, configure the following environment variables:  

1. `_APP_SMS_FROM` - +123456789
2. `_APP_SMS_PROVIDER` - sms://username:password@mock

**Email Notifications**  
To enable email notifications, configure these environment variables:  

1. `_APP_SMTP_HOST` - smtp.example.com
2. `_APP_SMTP_PASSWORD` - password
3. `_APP_SMTP_PORT` - 587
4. `_APP_SMTP_SECURE` - true
5. `_APP_SMTP_USERNAME` - username

**GitHub Integration**  
To enable GitHub authentication for your Appwrite console, set these environment variables:  

1. `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_APP_ID`  
2. `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_APP_NAME`  
3. `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`  
4. `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`  
5. `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`

The [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps) provide more information on configuring your Github app.

# Troubleshooting {% #troubleshooting %}

1. **Site redirected you too many times**  
   If you encounter the error `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` with the default Coolify configuration, turn off the **Strip Prefixes** option in the **Settings** page for the three containers with exposed ports: Appwrite, Appwrite Console, and Appwrite Realtime. If you're using Cloudflare and the issue persists, update the SSL/TLS encryption setting to Full in the Cloudflare dashboard. Navigate to `Your Domain` -> `SSL/TLS` -> `Overview` and make the change there.
