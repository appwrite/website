# Configure Function runtimes {% #functions %}

Not all function runtimes are enabled by default. Enable the runtimes that you need and disable unused runtimes to save disk space on your server.
To enable a runtime, add it to the `_APP_FUNCTIONS_RUNTIMES` environment variable as a comma-separated list.

The example below would enable Dart 2.15, .NET 6.0, and Java 18 runtimes.

```bash
_APP_FUNCTIONS_RUNTIMES=dart-2.15,dotnet-6.0,java-18.0
```

You can find a full list of supported runtimes [here](/docs/products/functions/runtimes#available-runtimes).

You can also configure the maximum timeout that can be set on individual Appwrite Functions. The maximum configurable timeout can be increased by changing the `_APP_FUNCTIONS_TIMEOUT` environment variable. This environment variable changes the configurable maximum but does not alter existing configurations of individual functions.

# SSL certificates for Function domains {% #ssl-certificates %}

Before setting up SSL certificates, ensure you have configured your DNS settings properly. You'll need to create a CNAME record that points your wildcard function domain (e.g. `*.functions.appwrite.myapp.com`) to your Appwrite domain.

Appwrite does not handle certificates for function domains (e.g. `6772722a00331315adc3.functions.appwrite.myapp.com`)
out of the box, since they require wildcard certificates.
There are two ways to handle certificate generation.

## Manual certificate generation

The simplest way to generate certificates for function domains is to use the Appwrite SSL command.

```bash
docker compose exec appwrite ssl --domain="6772722a00331315adc3.functions.appwrite.myapp.com"
```

The certificate should be generated within a few seconds.
If you encounter any issues, you can check the certificate worker logs.

```bash
docker compose logs appwrite-worker-certificates
```

Note that you'll need to run this command for each function domain, and repeat it every time you create a new function.
If you have many functions or frequently create new ones, consider using the automated certificate generation method below.

## Automated certificate generation

For automated certificate generation, Appwrite uses Traefik's DNS Challenge feature.
This is required for wildcard certificates (like `*.functions.appwrite.myapp.com`)
because Let's Encrypt uses the DNS-01 challenge to validate wildcard domain ownership.

### Using DNS challenge with DigitalOcean

To configure Traefik for automated certificate generation with DigitalOcean,
you need to modify your `docker-compose.yml`:

1. Add the following under the `traefik` service's `command` section.

```yaml
command:
    # ... existing commands ...
    - --certificatesresolvers.digitalocean.acme.dnschallenge=true
    - --certificatesresolvers.digitalocean.acme.dnschallenge.provider=digitalocean
    - --certificatesresolvers.digitalocean.acme.email=$_APP_SYSTEM_SECURITY_EMAIL_ADDRESS
    - --certificatesresolvers.digitalocean.acme.storage=/storage/certificates/digitalocean.json
```

2. Add environment variables under the `traefik` service.

```yaml
environment:
    - DO_AUTH_TOKEN=$_APP_DOMAIN_DO_TOKEN
```

3. Add the following `labels` under the `appwrite` service.

```yaml
labels:
    # ... existing labels ...
    - traefik.http.routers.appwrite_api_https.tls.certresolver=digitalocean
    - traefik.http.routers.appwrite_api_https.tls.domains[0].main=$_APP_DOMAIN_FUNCTIONS
    - traefik.http.routers.appwrite_api_https.tls.domains[0].sans=*.$_APP_DOMAIN_FUNCTIONS
```

4. Ensure these environment variables are properly configured in your `.env` file before proceeding:
    - `_APP_SYSTEM_SECURITY_EMAIL_ADDRESS` must be set to a valid email for Let's Encrypt notifications
    - `_APP_DOMAIN_FUNCTIONS` must be correctly set to your function domain (e.g., `functions.example.com`)
    - `_APP_DOMAIN_DO_TOKEN` must be set to a valid DigitalOcean API token (generate this in the DigitalOcean Console)

5. Apply the changes.

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

### Troubleshooting DNS Propagation

If certificate generation fails, first check the Traefik logs to identify the specific issue.

```bash
docker compose logs traefik
```

A common issue is DNS propagation delays. If the logs show DNS verification failures, you can configure longer timeouts in your `docker-compose.yml` under the `traefik` service.

```yaml
environment:
    - DO_AUTH_TOKEN=$_APP_DOMAIN_DO_TOKEN
    - DO_POLLING_INTERVAL=1m
    - DO_PROPAGATION_TIMEOUT=1h
```

Note: Let's Encrypt has strict rate limits for certificate requests. If you encounter rate limit errors in the logs, you may need to wait a few hours before trying again.

For other DNS providers, refer to [Traefik's DNS providers documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#providers).
