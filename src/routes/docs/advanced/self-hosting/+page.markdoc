title: Self-hosting
description: Set up your self-hosted Appwrite instance with ease. Follow the installation guide to configure and deploy Appwrite on your infrastructure for complete control.
---

Appwrite was designed from the ground up with self-hosting in mind. You can install and run Appwrite on any operating system that can run a [Docker CLI](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Self-hosted Appwrite instances can be configured flexibly with access to the same features found on Appwrite Cloud.

# System requirements {% #system-requirements %}

Appwrite is designed to run well on both small and large deployments. The minimum requirements to run Appwrite are as little as **2 CPU cores** and **4GB of RAM**, with **2GB of swap memory**, and an operating system that supports Docker.

Appwrite requires [Docker Compose Version 2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). To install Appwrite, make sure your Docker installation is updated to support Composer V2.

{% info title="Upgrading From Older Versions" %}
If you are migrating from an older version of Appwrite, you need to follow the [migration instructions](/docs/advanced/self-hosting/update)

# Install with Docker {% #install-with-docker %}

The easiest way to start running your Appwrite server is by running our Docker installer tool from your terminal. Before running the installation command, make sure you have [Docker CLI](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your host machine.

You will be prompted to configure the following during the setup command:

1. Your Appwrite instance's HTTP and HTTPS ports.
2. Your Appwrite instance's secret key used to encrypt sensitive data.
3. Your Appwrite instance's main hostname. Appwrite will generate a certificate using this hostname.
4. Your Appwrite instance's DNS A record hostname. Typically set to the same value as your Appwrite instance's hostname.

# One-click setups {% #one-click-setups %}

In addition to running Appwrite locally, you can also launch Appwrite using a pre-configured setup. This allows you to get up and running with Appwrite quickly without installing Docker on your local machine.

# Manual (Docker Compose) {% #manual %}

For advanced Docker users, the manual installation might seem more familiar. To set up Appwrite manually, download the Appwrite base [`docker-compose.yml`](https://appwrite.io/install/compose) and [`.env`](https://appwrite.io/install/env) files, then move them inside a directory named `appwrite`. After the download completes, update the different environment variables as you wish in the `.env` file and start the Appwrite stack using the following Docker command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

Once the Docker installation completes, go to your machine's hostname or IP address on your browser to access the Appwrite Console. Please note that on hosts that are not Linux-native, the server might take a few minutes to start after installation completes.

# Stop {% #stop %}

You can stop your Appwrite containers by using the following command executed from the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker compose stop
```

# Uninstall {% #uninstall %}

To stop and remove your Appwrite containers, you can use the following command executed from the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
