Appwrite's Storage Service can be configured to store files locally, or with self-hosted and cloud storage services. 
By default, Appwrite's Storage Service **stores files on your server's local storage**.
If you expect large volumes of data or the need to have scalable data storage, you may choose to use a separate storage service.

# Available adpters {% #adapters %}
Appwrite supports AWS S3, Digital Ocean Spaces, Backblaze, Akamai Object Storage, and Wasabi as storage adapters. 
Some of these services can be self-hosted, just like Appwrite.

You can select which storage adapter to use by setting the `_APP_STORAGE_DEVICE` environment variable. Valid values are `local`, `s3`, `dospaces`, `backblaze`, `linode`, and `wasabi`. Each storage adapter requires its own set of additional environment variables to configure.

# Maximum file size {% #adapters %}

The maximum size for a single file upload is controlled by the `_APP_STORAGE_LIMIT` environment variable, which defaults to 30 MB.
