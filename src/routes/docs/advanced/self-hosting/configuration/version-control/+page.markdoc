## Apply configuration

After creating your GitHub App, restart your Appwrite services to apply the configuration:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Verify configuration

To verify that your GitHub App is correctly configured:

1. Open the Appwrite Console and navigate to a project.
2. Go to either the Functions or Sites section.
3. Try creating a new Function or Site using GitHub as the source.
4. You should be prompted to install your GitHub App on your repositories.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your GitHub App integration:

- Ensure your Appwrite instance is publicly accessible, as GitHub needs to send webhook events.
- Check that the webhook URL is correctly formatted with your domain.
- Verify the permissions granted to the GitHub App are correct.
- Check the Appwrite logs for any errors related to GitHub integration:

```bash
docker compose logs appwrite
```
