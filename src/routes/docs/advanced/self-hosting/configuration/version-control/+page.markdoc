## Environment variables {% #github-variables %}

After creating your app, you'll have to configure the following environment variables.

| Variable                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_APP_DOMAIN`                    | Your main Appwrite domain used to access the Appwrite Console. When setting a public suffix domain, Appwrite will attempt to issue a valid SSL certificate automatically. When used with a dev domain, Appwrite will assign a self-signed SSL certificate. If you're using a proxy for **localhost development**, such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), this will be the domain of your localhost proxy.                       |
| `_APP_DOMAIN_TARGET`             | A hostname to serve as a CNAME target for your Appwrite custom domains. You can use the same value as used for the Appwrite `_APP_DOMAIN` variable. If you're using a proxy for **localhost development**, such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), this will be the domain of your localhost proxy, such as `dd65-2405-201-4013-d8d7-b4c5-fb73-39f9-285c.ngrok.io`.                                                              |
| `_APP_DOMAIN_FUNCTIONS`          | This will be used for system generated [Function Domains](/docs/products/functions/domains). When a function domain is generated, it will be `[UNIQUE_ID].[_APP_DOMAIN_FUNCTIONS]`. If `_APP_DOMAIN_FUNCTIONS` is set to `example.com` for example, the generated domain for functions will be something like `64d4d22db370ae41a32e.example.com`. You can use the same value as used for the Appwrite `_APP_DOMAIN` variable. |
| `_APP_DOMAIN_SITES`              | This will be used for system generated [Site Domains](/docs/products/sites/domains). When a site domain is generated, it will be `[UNIQUE_ID].[_APP_DOMAIN_SITES]`. If `_APP_DOMAIN_SITES` is set to `example.com` for example, the generated domain for sites will be something like `64d4d22db370ae41a32e.example.com`. You can use the same value as used for the Appwrite `_APP_DOMAIN` variable.                         |
| `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_APP_NAME`       | Name of your GitHub app. This is the display name you'll see on GitHub and it will be visible in your GitHub app's URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`    | RSA private key from GitHub wrapped with double quotes and newlines replaced with `\n`. You can generate private keys from GitHub application settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_APP_ID`         | GitHub application ID. You can find it in your GitHub application details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`      | GitHub client ID. You can find it in your GitHub application details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`  | GitHub client secret. You can generate secrets in your GitHub application settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `_APP_VCS_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | GitHub webhook secret. You can configure it in your GitHub application settings under webhook section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Update existing GitHub apps {% #existing-apps %}

There are additional steps if you're updating permissions in existing GitHub apps.
Every time you update your GitHub app's permissions, GitHub will prompt you to review the changes.
You will receive an email and you'll find a prompt under **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Applications** > **Installed GitHub Apps** > find your GitHub app > **Configure**.
You need to accept the new permissions so they're applied to your app.

## Apply configuration {% #apply-configuration %}

After creating your GitHub App, restart your Appwrite services to apply the configuration:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Verify configuration {% #verify-configuration %}

To verify that your GitHub App is correctly configured:

1. Open the Appwrite Console and navigate to a project.
2. Go to either the Functions or Sites section.
3. Try creating a new Function or Site using GitHub as the source.
4. You should be prompted to install your GitHub App on your repositories.

## Troubleshooting {% #troubleshooting %}

There are additional steps if you're updating permissions in existing GitHub apps.
Every time you update your GitHub app's permissions, GitHub will prompt you to review the changes.
You will receive an email and you'll find a prompt under **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Applications** > **Installed GitHub Apps** > find your GitHub app > **Configure**.
You need to accept the new permissions so they're applied to your app.

## Troubleshooting {% #troubleshooting %}

If you encounter issues with your GitHub App integration:

- Ensure your Appwrite instance is publicly accessible, as GitHub needs to send webhook events.
- Check that the webhook URL is correctly formatted with your domain.
- Verify the permissions granted to the GitHub App are correct.
- Check the Appwrite logs for any errors related to GitHub integration:

```bash
docker compose logs appwrite
```
