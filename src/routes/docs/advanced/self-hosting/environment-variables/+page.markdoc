Appwrite environment variables allow you to edit your server setup configuration and customize it. You can easily change the environment variables by changing them when running Appwrite using Docker CLI or Docker Compose.

Updating your Appwrite environment variables requires you to edit your Appwrite `.env` file. Your Docker files should be located inside the "appwrite" folder at the location where you first run the Appwrite installation script. It's recommended to use the `.env` file as a central point for updating your Appwrite configuration rather than changing them directly in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

After editing your `docker-compose.yml` or `.env` files, you will need to recreate your Appwrite stack by running the following compose command in your terminal:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can verify if the changes have been successfully applied by running this command:
```bash
docker compose exec appwrite vars
```

# General {% #general %}
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `_APP_ENV` | Set your server running environment. By default, the var is set to 'development'. When deploying to production, change it to: 'production'. |
| `_APP_LOCALE` | Set your Appwrite's locale. By default, the locale is set to 'en'. |
| `_APP_OPTIONS_ABUSE` | Allows you to disable abuse checks and API rate limiting. By default, set to 'enabled'. To cancel the abuse checking, set to 'disabled'. It is not recommended to disable this check-in a production environment. |
| `_APP_OPTIONS_ROUTER_FORCE_HTTPS` | **version >= 1.7.0** Allows you to force HTTPS connection to function and site domains. This feature redirects any HTTP call to HTTPS and adds the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to all HTTP responses. By default, set to `enabled`. To disable, set to `disabled`. This feature will work only when your ports are set to default 80 and 443. |
| `_APP_OPTIONS_FORCE_HTTPS` | Deprecated since 1.7.0. Allows you to force HTTPS connection to your API. This feature redirects any HTTP call to HTTPS and adds the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to all HTTP responses. By default, set to `enabled`. To disable, set to `disabled`. This feature will work only when your ports are set to default 80 and 443. |
| `_APP_OPTIONS_FUNCTIONS_FORCE_HTTPS` | Deprecated since 1.7.0. Allows you to force HTTPS connection to function domains. This feature redirects any HTTP call to HTTPS and adds the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to all HTTP responses. By default, set to `enabled`. To disable, set to `disabled`. This feature will work only when your ports are set to default 80 and 443. |
| `_APP_OPENSSL_KEY_V1` | This is your server private secret key that is used to encrypt all sensitive data on your server. Appwrite server encrypts all secret data on your server like webhooks, HTTP passwords, user sessions, and storage files. The var is not set by default, if you wish to take advantage of Appwrite encryption capabilities you should change it and make sure to **keep it a secret and have a backup for it**. |
| `_APP_DOMAIN` | Your Appwrite domain address. When setting a public suffix domain, Appwrite will attempt to issue a valid SSL certificate automatically. When used with a dev domain, Appwrite will assign a self-signed SSL certificate. The default value is 'localhost'. |
| `_APP_DOMAIN_TARGET` | Deprecated since 1.7.0. A DNS A record hostname to serve as a CNAME target for your Appwrite custom domains. You can use the same value as used for the Appwrite `_APP_DOMAIN` variable. The default value is 'localhost'. |
| `_APP_DOMAIN_TARGET_CNAME` | **version >= 1.7.0** A domain that can be used as DNS CNAME record to point to instance of Appwrite server. The default value is 'localhost'. |
| `_APP_DOMAIN_TARGET_A` | **version >= 1.7.0** An IPV4 that can be used as DNS A record to point to instance of Appwrite server. The default value is '127.0.0.1'. |
| `_APP_DOMAIN_TARGET_AAAA` | **version >= 1.7.0** An IPv6 that can be used as DNS AAAA record to point to instance of Appwrite server. The default value is '::1'. |
| `_APP_CONSOLE_WHITELIST_ROOT`| This option allows you to disable the creation of new users on the Appwrite console. When enabled only 1 user will be able to use the registration form. New users can be added by inviting them to your project. By default this option is enabled. |
| `_APP_CONSOLE_WHITELIST_EMAILS` | This option allows you to limit creation of new users on the Appwrite console. This option is very useful for small teams or sole developers. To enable it, pass a list of allowed email addresses separated by a comma. |
| `_APP_CONSOLE_WHITELIST_IPS` | This last option allows you to limit creation of users in Appwrite console for users sharing the same set of IP addresses. This option is very useful for team working with a VPN service or a company IP. To enable/activate this option, pass a list of allowed IP addresses separated by a comma. |
| `_APP_SYSTEM_EMAIL_NAME`| This is the sender name value that will appear on email messages sent to developers from the Appwrite console. The default value is: 'Appwrite'. You can use url encoded strings for spaces and special chars. |
| `_APP_SYSTEM_EMAIL_ADDRESS`  | This is the sender email address that will appear on email messages sent to developers from the Appwrite console. The default value is 'team@appwrite.io'. You should choose an email address that is allowed to be used from your SMTP server to avoid the server email ending in the users' SPAM folders. |
| `_APP_SYSTEM_RESPONSE_FORMAT` | Use this environment variable to set the default Appwrite HTTP response format to support an older version of Appwrite. This option is useful to overcome breaking changes between versions. You can also use the `X-Appwrite-Response-Format` HTTP request header to overwrite the response for a specific request. This variable accepts any valid Appwrite version. To use the current version format, leave the value of the variable empty. |
| `_APP_SYSTEM_SECURITY_EMAIL_ADDRESS` | This is the email address used to issue SSL certificates for custom domains or the user agent in your webhooks payload. |
| `_APP_USAGE_STATS` | This variable allows you to disable the collection and displaying of usage stats. This value is set to 'enabled' by default, to disable the usage stats set the value to 'disabled'. When disabled, it's recommended to turn off the Worker Usage container to reduce resource usage. |
| `_APP_LOGGING_PROVIDER` |  Deprecated since 1.6.0, use `_APP_LOGGING_CONFIG` with DSN value instead. This variable allows you to enable logging errors to 3rd party providers. This value is empty by default, set the value to one of `sentry`, `raygun`, `appSignal`, `logOwl` to enable the logger. |
| `_APP_LOGGING_CONFIG`  | This variable allows you to enable logging errors to third party providers. This value is empty by default, set a DSN value to one of the following `sentry://PROJECT_ID:SENTRY_API_KEY@SENTRY_HOST/`, , `logowl://SERVICE_TICKET@SERIVCE_HOST/` `raygun://RAYGUN_API_KEY/`, `appSignal://API_KEY/` to enable the logger. For versions prior `1.5.6` you can use the old syntax. Old syntax: If using Sentry, this should be `SENTRY_API_KEY;SENTRY_APP_ID`. If using Raygun, this should be Raygun API key. If using AppSignal, this should be AppSignal API key. If using LogOwl, this should be LogOwl Service Ticket. |
| `_APP_USAGE_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL` | **(version >= 1.1.0)** Interval value containing the number of seconds that the Appwrite usage process should wait before aggregating stats and syncing it to Database from TimeSeries data. The default value is 30 seconds. Reintroduced in 1.1.0. |
| `_APP_USAGE_TIMESERIES_INTERVAL` | **(version >= 1.0.0)** Deprecated since 1.1.0 uses `_APP_USAGE_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL` instead. |
| `_APP_USAGE_DATABASE_INTERVAL` |  **(version >= 1.0.0)** Deprecated since 1.1.0 uses `_APP_USAGE_AGGREGATION_INTERVAL` instead. |
| `_APP_WORKER_PER_CORE` |  **(version >= 0.13.0)** Internal Worker per core for the API, Realtime and Executor containers. Can be configured to optimize performance. |

# SMTP {% #smtp %}

Appwrite is using an SMTP server for emailing your projects users and server admins. The SMTP env vars are used to allow Appwrite server to connect to the SMTP container.

If running in production, it might be easier to use a 3rd party SMTP server as it might be a little more difficult to set up a production SMTP server that will not send all your emails into your user's **spam folder**.
