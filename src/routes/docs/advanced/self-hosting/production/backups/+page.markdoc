description: Learn how to set up and manage backups for your self-hosted Appwrite instance to ensure data safety and disaster recovery.

{% info title="Looking for automated backups?" %}
Appwrite Cloud offers automated [Backups as a Service](/docs/products/databases/backups) with scheduling and one-click restore.

For self-hosted instances, you'll need to implement manual backup procedures as outlined on this page.
{% /info %}

Self-hosted Appwrite requires manual backup procedures to protect your data.

# What to back up {% #what-to-backup %}

Your Appwrite installation has several components that need backing up:

1. **Database** - User data, documents, and configuration
2. **Storage volumes** - Uploaded files and function code
3. **Environment variables** - Configuration in `.env`
4. **System snapshots** - Complete server state (alternative approach)

# Database backups {% #database-backup %}

Appwrite uses MariaDB. Use `mysqldump` for most installations:

```bash
# Create database backup
docker compose exec mariadb sh -c 'exec mysqldump --all-databases --add-drop-database --single-transaction -u"$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD"' > ./dump.sql

# Restore (fresh installation only)
docker compose exec -T mariadb sh -c 'exec mysql -u"$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD"' < dump.sql
```

{% info title="Important" %}
Only restore to fresh Appwrite installations to avoid data corruption.
{% /info %}

For large databases, consider `mariabackup` for physical backups.

# Storage volume backups {% #storage-backup %}

Shut down Appwrite before backing up volumes to avoid data inconsistency.

Appwrite uses these Docker volumes:

- `appwrite-uploads` - User files
- `appwrite-functions` - Function code
- `appwrite-builds` - Build artifacts
- `appwrite-sites` - Static sites
- `appwrite-certificates` - SSL certificates
- `appwrite-config` - Configuration
- `appwrite-cache` and `appwrite-redis` - Cache data
- `appwrite-mariadb` - Database files

## Backup methods

**Docker volume backup:**
```bash
# Backup volume
docker run --rm -v volume_name:/data -v $(pwd)/backup:/backup ubuntu tar czf "/backup/volume_name.tar.gz" -C /data .

# Restore volume
docker run --rm -v volume_name:/data -v $(pwd)/backup:/backup ubuntu tar xzf "/backup/volume_name.tar.gz" -C /data
```

**Direct copy:**
```bash
docker volume inspect volume_name
sudo cp -a /var/lib/docker/volumes/volume_name/_data /backup/volume_name_backup
```



{% info title="External storage" %}
For S3/GCS/Azure storage, use your provider's native backup tools.
{% /info %}

# Environment variables {% #env-backup %}

Back up your `.env` file containing configuration and secrets:

```bash
cp .env .env.backup.$(date +"%Y%m%d")
```

{% info title="Critical variable" %}
The `_APP_OPENSSL_KEY_V1` encrypts your data. Copy this exact value when restoring, or encrypted data becomes inaccessible.
{% /info %}

Store `.env` backups securely due to sensitive data.

# System snapshots {% #system-snapshots %}

As an alternative to individual backups, snapshot your entire server:

**AWS EC2:** Actions > Image > Create Image
**GCP/Azure/DigitalOcean:** Use provider snapshot features

System snapshots capture complete server state and enable fast recovery, but use more storage than selective backups.

# Best practices {% #best-practices %}

## Automation

**Schedule backups** with cron jobs or cloud automation:
```bash
# Daily database backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup-script.sh
```

**Follow 3-2-1 rule:** 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite.

**Monitor backup jobs** and set alerts for failures.

## Third-party tools

For production environments:
- **Restic** - Cross-platform backup with encryption
- **Borg** - Deduplicating backup program
- **Velero** - Kubernetes backup solution
- **Cloud provider tools** - AWS/Azure/GCP backup services

## Disaster recovery

Define your requirements:
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** - Acceptable data loss window
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** - Acceptable downtime window

**Test restores quarterly** to verify backup integrity.

Keep backups **offsite** and **encrypted**. Document recovery procedures and update contact information.

## Security

- Encrypt backup files
- Restrict backup storage access
- Audit backup systems regularly
- Meet compliance requirements for your industry
