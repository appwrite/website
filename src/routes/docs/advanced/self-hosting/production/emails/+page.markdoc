Sending emails is hard. There are a lot of spam rules and configurations to master in order to set up a functional SMTP server. While it is okay to use a self-hosted SMTP server during development, you should use a third-party SMTP provider for production so your email doesn't get labeled as spam.

You can [change Appwrite's SMTP settings](/docs/advanced/self-hosting/configuration/email) and credentials to any 3rd party provider you like that supports SMTP integration using our Docker environment variables. Most SMTP providers offer a decent free tier to get started with.
