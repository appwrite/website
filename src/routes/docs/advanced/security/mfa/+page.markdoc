title: Multi-factor Authentication
description: Appwrite helps you secure your developer accounts with MFA (multi-factor authentication).
---
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds multiple layers of authentication to your Appwrite account.
When MFA is enabled, a malicious actor needs to compromise multiple authentication factors to gain unauthorized access.
Appwrite currently supports MFA using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) with an authenticator app.
More factors of authentication will be added in the future.

{% info title="Looking to add MFA to your app?" %}
This page covers MFA for your Appwrite Console account.
If you're looking to add MFA to your app, follow the [Multi-factor authentication journey](/docs/products/auth/mfa).

# Enable MFA {% #enable-mfa %}
To enable MFA on your Appwrite account, navigate to your Appwrite Console > your account menu on the top right > **Your account** > **Multi-factor authentication**.

Scan the QR code with your authenticator app, then enter the code from your authenticator app to verify the setup.
Make sure to save the recovery codes in a safe place, as they are the only way to access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app.
