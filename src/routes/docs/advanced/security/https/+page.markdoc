description: Learn how Appwrite Cloud enforces secure connections by enforcing HTTPS on all endpoints.

Appwrite Cloud serves all endpoints over an HTTPS connection by default. 
Requests made through an unsecure HTTP connection will be redirected to.

Redirected requests will show a `301` response status.

```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/<ENDPOINT>
```

Appwrite Cloud does not support HTTP, which is a common practice in modern development, because unencrypted
HTTP traffic is dangerous and exposes sensitive user data to malicious attackers.

# Strict-Transport-Security {% #strict-transport-security %}
Appwrite uses the [Strict-Transport-Security header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
to inform browsers that the website should only be accessed using HTTPS, further protecting against 
man-in-the-middle attacks such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. 
By enforcing HTTPS, Appwrite Cloud's endpoint will always be served over a secure connection, which helps protect users' data and privacy.

# Custom domains {% #custom-domains %}
You can add a [custom domain](/docs/advanced/platform/custom-domains) to your Appwrite project so you can access Appwrite API endpoints
on your own domain. Appwrite will [generate TLS certificates](/docs/advanced/security/tls) for your domain and enforce HTTPS communication.

# Function domains {% #function-domains %}
Appwrite generates domains for Appwrite Functions so they can be executed through HTTPS requests.
Appwrite also [generates TLS certificates](/docs/advanced/security/tls) for these domains to enforce HTTPS communication.
