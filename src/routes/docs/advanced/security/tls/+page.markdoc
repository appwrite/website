description: Appwrite helps keep the web secure by generating TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates for all user and generated domains.

Appwrite generates TLS certificates to ensure your API traffic is appropriately encrypted. The certificate authority used depends on your deployment type:

- **Self-hosted deployments** use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), an open source and not-for-profit certificate authority provided by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) that secures more than 363 million websites.
- **Appwrite Cloud** uses [Certainly](https://docs.fastly.com/products/certainly), Fastly's certificate authority, for Sites and Functions.

TLS certificates are generated for all of the following.
- Appwrite products and endpoints, like Databases, Storage, Authentication, Functions, Messaging, and all other endpoints.
- [Custom domains](/docs/advanced/platform/custom-domains) that you configure for your Appwrite projects.
- [Domains for Appwrite Functions](/docs/products/functions/domains), generated or user provided.
- [Domains for Appwrite Sites](/docs/products/sites/domains), generated or user provided.

TLS certificates are crucial to ensure all connections between your apps and Appwrite Cloud are encrypted.
This protects your users from attack vectors like man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks.
