title: Abuse protection
description: Learn how Appwrite protects your apps from abuse through rate limiting and cross-site scripting protection.
---
Appwrite comes packaged with tools to protect against various forms of abuse, like brute force attacks, data scraping, and many
other common forms of abuse. 

# Rate limiting {% #rate-limiting %}
Appwrite uses rate limits on some endpoints to avoid abuse or brute-force attacks against Appwrite's REST API.
Each Appwrite route documentation has information about any rate limits that might apply to them.

Rate limits limit the number of requests a user or IP can make against an API within a period of time.
Rate limits help protect against brute force attacks against authentication endpoints and other forms of API
abuse like [denial of service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).

# Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) {% #CORS %}
Appwrite limits who can make requests to Appwrite's APIs by default.
This means that unless your app's domain is added to Appwrite as a platform, requests are rejected.
By being explicit with the domains that are allowed
to make requests to your Appwrite project, requests from JavaScript hosted on unknown domains 
will not be accepted.

You can add new platforms by navigating to **Overview** > **Platforms** > **Add platform**.
