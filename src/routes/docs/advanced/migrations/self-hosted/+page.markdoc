Migrations makes it as easy as a couple clicks to move all of your self-hosted project data to a Cloud instance.

{% section #notices step=1 title="Things to keep in mind" %}

1. Data transferred by migrations will reset `$createdAt` and `$updatedAt` timestamps to the date of the migration.

2. Your self-hosted Appwrite project must be accessible from the internet for the migration to work.

3. Migrations are non-destructive. No data will be deleted or lost in the source project.

To begin migrating to Cloud, make sure to read the [migration overview](/docs/advanced/migrations)  
and [things to keep in mind](#notices) sections above.

1. Navigate to your self-hosted project's Console and click on the **Migrations** tab.

2. Click **Deploy to Cloud**, you will be redirected to Appwrite Cloud.

3. You will complete the migration on Appwrite Cloud.

1. Once redirected to Appwrite Cloud, you'll be prompted to select an organization and a project. You can migrate to an existing project or create a new one.

2. Select the data you wish to migrate. You can choose among accounts, databases, rows, files, and functions.

3. Click **Start migration** to start the migration process. You do not need to keep the Appwrite Console open through the process.
