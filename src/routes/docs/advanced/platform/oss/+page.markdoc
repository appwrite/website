Appwrite remains open source and continues to offer support to open source maintainers that build fundemental software that modern developers depend upon. If you've got a growing open source project that can use our help, we're here for you.

If your open source project has out-grown our free Starter plan, [contact us](https://appwrite.io/contact-us) to apply for a free Pro plan.
