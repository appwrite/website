Appwrite Cloud provides flexible plans that meets your needs, whether you're developing hobby and side projects, or delivering production ready code to millions of users.
This page covers differences between different plans and the behavior when you switch between plans.

# Plans {% #plans %}

Appwrite Cloud provides three different plans tailored to each project's unique needs. 
Appwrite Cloud's generous **Starter** plan is enough for most projects to build a user base and gain momentum.
Appwrite's **Pro** plan and **Scale** plan are pay per member and pay per organization respectively, and help you scale your growing projects to any sized audience.

You can compare each of the plans in the [pricing page](https://appwrite.io/pricing).
