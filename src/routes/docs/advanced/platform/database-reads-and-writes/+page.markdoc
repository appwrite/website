Appwrite provides powerful database capabilities through its [database API](/docs/products/databases), allowing you to perform read and write operations across your application data. Understanding how these operations are counted and billed is essential for planning your application's scalability.

## Database Operations

Database operations in Appwrite are categorized into two types:

**Read Operations**: Any action that retrieves data from your database, including:
- Fetching documents with `getDocument` or `listDocuments`
- Running queries with `find`
- Counting documents with `count`

**Write Operations**: Any action that modifies data in your database, including:
- Creating documents with `createDocument`
- Updating documents with `updateDocument`
- Deleting documents with `deleteDocument`
- Batch operations that modify multiple documents

How it works:
1. Perform database operations through the Appwrite SDK or API
2. Appwrite automatically tracks and logs these operations
3. Operations are counted based on the number of documents affected, not API calls
4. Quotas are refreshed monthly based on your subscription plan

For example, if you fetch a collection of 50 documents with a single API call, this counts as 50 read operations, not as a single operation.

## Best Practices

To optimize your database operations and control costs:

1. **Use efficient queries**: Filter data on the server side rather than retrieving large datasets and filtering client-side
2. **Implement pagination**: Use the `limit` and `offset` parameters to retrieve only the data you need
3. **Monitor usage**: Keep track of your database operations through the Appwrite Console
4. **Consider caching**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce repeated read operations
