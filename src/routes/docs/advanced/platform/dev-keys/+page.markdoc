title: Dev keys
description: Bypass Appwrite rate limits and CORS errors in your development environment with Appwrite Dev keys.
---

Dev keys are secrets used by Appwrite [Client SDKs](/docs/sdks#client) to avoid abuse limits in testing. They are meant to be used specifically in development environments, where they hold several developer experience-related benefits:

- Appwrite rate limits and CORS errors are bypassed
- Configurable expiration date with 1 day, 7 days, 30 day options as well as manual date selection

This is highly beneficial in scenarios where you are repeatedly sending the same requests to Appwrite in a short period of time, such as manual or E2E testing and checks in your CI/CD pipeline.

{% info title="Important note" %}
Dev keys should never be used in production environments, only in development environments, as they can make your app more susceptible to abuse and security breaches.

To create a new API key, navigate to **Overview** > **Integration** > **Dev keys** and click **Create Dev key**.

You can then implement the dev key while initializing the Appwrite client in your app.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>')
    .setDevKey('<YOUR_DEV_KEY>'); // Your dev key
```

```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

Client client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>')
    .setDevKey('<YOUR_DEV_KEY>'); // Your dev key
```

```client-react-native
import { Client } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>')
    .setDevKey('<YOUR_DEV_KEY>'); // Your dev key
```

```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>")
    .setDevKey("<YOUR_DEV_KEY>") // Your dev key
```

```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>")
    .setDevKey("<YOUR_DEV_KEY>") // Your dev key
```

```client-android-java
import io.appwrite.Client;

Client client = new Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>")
    .setDevKey("<YOUR_DEV_KEY>"); // Your dev key
```
{% /multicode %}

If you need to replace your dev key, create a new key, update your app credentials and, once ready, delete your old key.
