Appwrite Cloud provides flexible plans that meets your needs, whether you're developing hobby and side projects, or delivering production ready code to millions of users.
This page covers differences between different plans and the behavior when you switch between plans.

# Plans {% #plans %}

Appwrite Cloud provides three different plans tailored to each project's unique needs. 
Appwrite Cloud's generous **Starter** plan is enough for most projects to build a user base and gain momentum.
Appwrite's **Pro** plan and **Scale** plan are pay per member and pay per organization respectively, and help you scale your growing projects to any sized audience.

You can compare each of the plans in the [pricing page](https://appwrite.io/pricing).

# Resource limits {% #resource-limits %}
Each plan in Appwrite Cloud has a set of resource limits. You can find the details of these resource limits in the in the [pricing page](https://appwrite.io/pricing).

Each resource limit is applied per month and resets at the beginning of each month.

## Switching to Starter plan and reaching limits {% #switching-to-starter-plan-reaching-resource-limits %}

When you switch from Pro or Scale plan to Starter plan, you will be able to take advantage of the existing limits until the end of the current billing period. 
After the billing period ends, the Starter plan limits and consequences will apply.

If an organisation has multiple members after the billing period ends, all admins besides the original creator of the organization will be removed.
The following consequences should also apply at the project level if the Starter plan per-project resource limits have been exceeded.
