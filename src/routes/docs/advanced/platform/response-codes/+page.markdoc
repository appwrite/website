title: Response codes
description: Understand Appwrite platform response codes for effective error handling. Learn how to interpret and handle response codes to enhance your application's reliability.
---

Appwrite uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error caused by invalid request, usually caused by user error.
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Appwrite, please check Docker container logs.

# Error messages {% #error-messages %}

When the Appwrite APIs return error messages, it does so in JSON format. For example, an error might look like this:

```json
{
    "message": "Invalid id: Parameter must be a valid number",
    "type": "argument_invalid",
    "code": 400
}
```

# Error types {% #error-types %}

Appwrite also passes convenient error types in addition to the HTTP response codes to help you get more fine-grained control over what went wrong and allowing you to display relevant error messages in your applications. Error types are convenient to identify the type of error that occurred.

For example, a `400` HTTP response code could indicate a Bad Request due to a variety of reasons, and error types can help you pinpoint the exact `400` error. Appwrite currently supports the following error types:
