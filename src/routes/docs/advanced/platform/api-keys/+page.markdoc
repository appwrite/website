title: API keys
description: Secure your application with Appwrite API Keys. Discover how to create and manage API keys to control access and enhance your application's security.

API keys are secrets used by Appwrite [Server SDKs](/docs/sdks#server) and the Appwrite CLI to prove their identity.
What can be accessed each API key is restricted by [scopes](#scopes) instead of permissions.

{% info title="Best practice" %}
It is a best practice to grant only the scopes you need to meet your project's goals to an API key. 
API keys should be treated as a secret. Never share the API key and keep API keys out of client applications.

# API keys vs Dev keys {% #api-keys-vs-dev-keys %}

API keys and [Dev keys](/docs/advanced/platform/dev-keys) are not the same and cannot be used interchangeably.

API keys permit access to Appwrite services in production environments, with access controlled through scopes to ensure secure and controlled server-side operations. Dev keys, conversely, are specifically designed to help you avoid abuse limits and CORS errors in test and development environments.

API keys are for server SDKs and the CLI in production environments, while Dev keys are for client SDKs in development environments.

To create a new API key, navigate to **Overview** > **Integration** > **API keys** and click **Create API key**.

You can then use the API key to initialize the Appwrite client in your server-side apps.

When adding a new API Key, you can choose which [scopes](#scopes) to grant your application. 
If you need to replace your API Key, create a new key, update your app credentials and, once ready, delete your old key.
