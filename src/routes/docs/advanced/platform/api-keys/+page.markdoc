title: API keys
description: Secure your application with Appwrite API Keys. Discover how to create and manage API keys to control access and enhance your application's security.

API keys are secrets used by Appwrite [Server SDKs](/docs/sdks#server) and the Appwrite CLI to prove their identity.
What can be accessed each API key is restricted by [scopes](#scopes) instead of permissions.

{% info title="Best practice" %}
It is a best practice to grant only the scopes you need to meet your project's goals to an API key. 
API keys should be treated as a secret. Never share the API key and keep API keys out of client applications.

To create a new API key, navigate to **Overview** > **Integration** > **API keys** and click **Create API key**.

When adding a new API Key, you can choose which [scopes](#scopes) to grant your application. 
If you need to replace your API Key, create a new key, update your app credentials and, once ready, delete your old key.
