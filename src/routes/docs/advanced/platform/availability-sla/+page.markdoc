# Credit request procedure {% #credit-request-procedure %}

To receive service credits, you must:

Submit a support ticket within **30 days** of the incident via the Appwrite Console, providing relevant data, logs, or screenshots.

# SLA exclusions {% #sla-exclusions %}

Downtime specifically excludes periods caused by:

- Scheduled maintenance activities communicated in advance.
- Events beyond our reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, third-party outages, governmental actions).
- Customer or third-party actions, including incorrect configurations or misuse of our services.
- Minor performance degradations that do not materially impact core functionality.
- External network issues beyond our infrastructure.

# Commitment to continuous improvement {% #commitment-to-continuous-improvement %}

We continuously strive to exceed the commitments outlined in this SLA by improving infrastructure resilience and service quality. While the maximum attainable uptime commitment is influenced by our upstream service providers, we aim for excellence and transparency in all operational matters.

# Modifications {% #modifications %}

We reserve the right to modify this SLA periodically. Changes will become effective upon publication on our website. Your continued use of our services indicates acceptance of these changes.
