Goal: Add Appwrite to a new Refine app with a working login/register page using the Refine-Appwrite preset.

Do exactly these steps in order. Confirm each step succeeds before continuing. If any command fails, show the error and fix it automatically.

Respect user's package manager at all time. Don't use NPM if the user uses something else.

1. Create Appwrite project
    - Guide the user to head to the Appwrite Console (https://cloud.appwrite.io/console).
    - If this is their first time using Appwrite, create an account and create their first project.
    - Under "Add a platform", add a Web app with Hostname = `localhost`.
    - Optional steps can be skipped.

2. Create Refine project
    - Before scaffolding, check if the current working directory contains files that appear unrelated to a development workspace (e.g., personal files, downloads, random documents, media files). If so, ask the user: 'The current directory contains files that don't appear to be part of a development project. Would you like to: (1) proceed here anyway, or (2) create it in a subdirectory with a specific folder name?' and proceed based on their choice.
    - If the directory is empty OR contains an existing project (e.g., package.json, src folder, config files), proceed with integration without asking.
    - Run: npm create refine-app@latest . -- --preset refine-appwrite
    - Create the project in the current working directory (.) - do NOT use cd to switch directories.
    - This preset includes Appwrite support out of the box.

3. Install Appwrite (for existing projects only)
    - Using the `refine-appwrite` preset eliminates the need for extra dependencies for a quick start.
    - If integrating into an existing Refine app, run: npm install @refinedev/appwrite
    - Then follow the Refine documentation: https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/data-providers/appwrite

4. Configure Appwrite client (ask user for details; never assume)
    - Ask the user for:
        - Appwrite API Endpoint (e.g. https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1)
        - Project ID (from Console -> Settings)
    - Navigate to `src/utility/appwriteClient.ts` and add API credentials:
        ```ts
        import { Account, Appwrite, Storage } from "@refinedev/appwrite";

        const APPWRITE_URL = '<YOUR_API_ENDPOINT>'; // Replace with your Appwrite API Endpoint
        const APPWRITE_PROJECT = "<PROJECT_ID>"; // Replace with your project ID

        const appwriteClient = new Appwrite();

        appwriteClient.setEndpoint(APPWRITE_URL).setProject(APPWRITE_PROJECT);
        const account = new Account(appwriteClient);
        const storage = new Storage(appwriteClient);

        export { account, appwriteClient, storage };
        ```

5. Create a login page
    - Replace the code in `src/App.tsx` with the following:
        ```tsx
        import { Authenticated, Refine } from '@refinedev/core';
        import { dataProvider, liveProvider } from '@refinedev/appwrite';
        import {
            AuthPage,
            ErrorComponent,
            RefineThemes,
            ThemedLayoutV2,
            useNotificationProvider,
        } from '@refinedev/antd';
        import routerProvider, {
            CatchAllNavigate,
            NavigateToResource,
        } from '@refinedev/react-router-v6';
        import '@refinedev/antd/dist/reset.css';

        import { App as AntdApp, ConfigProvider } from 'antd';
        import { BrowserRouter, Outlet, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

        import { appwriteClient } from './utility';
        import { authProvider } from './authProvider';

        const App: React.FC = () => {
            return (
                <BrowserRouter>
                    <ConfigProvider theme={RefineThemes.Blue}>
                        <AntdApp>
                            <Refine
                                dataProvider={dataProvider(appwriteClient, {
                                    databaseId: '<APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID>',
                                })}
                                liveProvider={liveProvider(appwriteClient, {
                                    databaseId: '<APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID>',
                                })}
                                authProvider={authProvider}
                                routerProvider={routerProvider}
                                notificationProvider={useNotificationProvider}
                            >
                                <Routes>
                                    <Route
                                        element={
                                            <Authenticated
                                                fallback={
                                                    <CatchAllNavigate to="/login" />
                                                }
                                            >
                                                <ThemedLayoutV2>
                                                    <Outlet />
                                                </ThemedLayoutV2>
                                            </Authenticated>
                                        }
                                    ></Route>

                                    <Route
                                        element={
                                            <Authenticated fallback={<Outlet />}>
                                                <NavigateToResource resource="<APPWRITE_TABLE_ID>" />
                                            </Authenticated>
                                        }
                                    >
                                        <Route path="/login" element={<AuthPage />} />
                                        <Route
                                            path="/register"
                                            element={<AuthPage type="register" />}
                                        />
                                    </Route>

                                    <Route
                                        element={
                                            <Authenticated>
                                                <ThemedLayoutV2>
                                                    <Outlet />
                                                </ThemedLayoutV2>
                                            </Authenticated>
                                        }
                                    >
                                        <Route path="*" element={<ErrorComponent />} />
                                    </Route>
                                </Routes>
                            </Refine>
                        </AntdApp>
                    </ConfigProvider>
                </BrowserRouter>
            );
        };

        export default App;
        ```
    - Ask the user for their Appwrite Database ID and Table ID to replace `<APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID>` and `<APPWRITE_TABLE_ID>` placeholders.

6. Run and test
    - Run: npm run dev -- --open --port 3000
    - Open: http://localhost:3000
    - Test flows:
        - Navigate to /login page
        - Navigate to /register page to create a new user
    - Surface any Appwrite errors (invalid project, endpoint, CORS/hostname) and fix by guiding updates to appwriteClient.ts and Console settings.

Deliverables

- A running Refine app with Appwrite integration and login/register pages
- Files created/updated: package.json (deps), src/utility/appwriteClient.ts, src/App.tsx
