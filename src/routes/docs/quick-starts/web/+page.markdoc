Learn how to add Appwrite to your web apps.
{% section #step-1 step=1 title="Create project" %}
Head to the [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console).

{% only_dark %}

{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}

{% /only_light %}

If this is your first time using Appwrite, create an account and create your first project.

Then, under **Add a platform**, add a **Web app**. 
The **Hostname** should be `localhost` or the domain on which you're hosting your web app.

You can install the Appwrite Web SDK using a package manager.
```sh
npm install appwrite
```

You can also add the Appwrite Web SDK using CDN with a script tag.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appwrite@13.0.1"></script>
```
{% /section %}
{% section #step-3 step=3 title="Import Appwrite" %}
```js
import { Client, Account } from 'appwrite';

export const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'); // Replace with your project ID

export const account = new Account(client);
export { ID } from 'appwrite';
```
{% /section %}

{% section #step-4 step=4 title="Using TypeScript" %}
If you prefer TypeScript, you can import TypeScript models from the Appwrite SDK.

```ts
// appwrite.ts

import { Client, Databases, Account } from "appwrite";
// Import type models for Appwrite
import { type Models } from 'appwrite';

const client: Client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'); // Replace with your project ID

export const account: Account = new Account(client);
export const database: Databases = new Databases(client);

// You then use the imported type definitions like this
const authUser: Models.Session = await account.createEmailSession(email, password);
```
{% /section %}

{% section #step-5 step=5 title="Extending TypeScript models" %}
Sometimes you'll need to extend TypeScript models with your own type definitions.

For example, when you fetch a list of documents from a collection, you can define the expected structure of the documents like this.
```ts
interface Idea extends Models.Document {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    userId: string;
}
```

When you fetch documents, you can use this new `Idea` interface like this.

```ts
const response = await database.listDocuments(
    ideasDatabaseId,
    ideasCollectionId,
    [Query.orderDesc("$createdAt"), Query.limit(queryLimit)]
);
const ideas = response.documents as Idea[];
```
