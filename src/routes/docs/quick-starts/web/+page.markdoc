Learn how to add Appwrite to your web apps.
{% section #step-1 step=1 title="Create project" %}
Head to the [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console).

{% only_dark %}
![Create project screen](/images/docs/quick-starts/dark/create-project.png)
{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}

{% /only_light %}

If this is your first time using Appwrite, create an account and create your first project.

Then, under **Add a platform**, add a **Web app**.
The **Hostname** should be `localhost` or the domain on which you're hosting your web app.

You can skip optional steps.

{% section #step-2 step=2 title="Install Appwrite" %}
You can install the Appwrite Web SDK using a package manager.
```sh
npm install appwrite@18.1.1
```

You can also add the Appwrite Web SDK using CDN by adding a script tag to your HTML file. The SDK will be available globally through the `Appwrite` namespace.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appwrite@17.0.0"></script>
```
{% /section %}
{% section #step-3 step=3 title="Initialize Appwrite" %}

If you installed via npm, you can import `Client` and `Account` from the Appwrite SDK.

```client-web
import { Client, Account } from 'appwrite';

export const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>'); // Replace with your project ID

export const account = new Account(client);
export { ID } from 'appwrite';
```

If you're using CDN, the library loads directly in your browser as a global object, so you access it through Appwrite instead of imports.

```js
const client = new Appwrite.Client()

client
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>') // Replace with your project ID

export const account = new Appwrite.Account(client)
export const tablesDb = new Appwrite.TablesDb(client)
```
{% /section %}

{% section #step-4 step=4 title="Using TypeScript" %}
If you prefer TypeScript, you can import TypeScript models from the Appwrite SDK.

```ts
// appwrite.ts

import { Client, TablesDb, Account } from "appwrite";
// Import type models for Appwrite
import { type Models } from 'appwrite';

const client: Client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>'); // Replace with your project ID

export const account: Account = new Account(client);
export const tablesDb: TablesDb = new TablesDb(client);

// You then use the imported type definitions like this
const authUser: Models.Session = await account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
```
{% /section %}

{% section #step-5 step=5 title="Extending TypeScript models" %}
Sometimes you'll need to extend TypeScript models with your own type definitions.

For example, when you fetch a list of rows from a table, you can define the expected structure of the rows like this.
```ts
interface Idea extends Models.Row {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    userId: string;
}
```

When you fetch rows, you can use this new `Idea` interface like this.

```ts
const response = await tablesDb.listRows(
    ideasDatabaseId,
    ideasTableId,
    [Query.orderDesc("$createdAt"), Query.limit(queryLimit)]
);
const ideas = response.rows as Idea[];
```
