Goal: Add Appwrite auth to a new Next.js app (App Router), with a working login/register/logout page.

Do exactly these steps in order. Confirm each step succeeds before continuing. If any command fails, show the error and fix it automatically.

Respect user's package manager at all time. Don't use NPM if the user uses something else.

1. Create Next.js app
    - Run: npx create-next-app@latest my-app --use-npm --no-tailwind --eslint
    - Change dir: cd my-app
    - When prompted: TypeScript = No, ESLint = Yes, Tailwind = No, src dir = your choice, App Router = Yes, Import alias = No.

2. Install Appwrite SDK
    - Run: npm install appwrite

3. Create Appwrite client module (ask user for details; never assume)
    - Ask the user for:
        - Appwrite Cloud Region (e.g. fra, nyc)
        - Project ID (from Console -> Settings)
          If the user doesnâ€™t know, guide them to Appwrite Console to copy these. Do not attempt to infer or access their project.
    - Create `.env.local` in the project root with:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
      NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
      Note: Do not commit `.env.local`. Next.js ignores it by default.
    - Create file: app/appwrite.js (or app/appwrite.ts if TS) with key snippet:
        ```js
        import { Client, Account } from 'appwrite';
        const endpoint = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT;
        const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID;
        if (!endpoint || !projectId)
            throw new Error('Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_* in .env.local');
        export const client = new Client().setEndpoint(endpoint).setProject(projectId);
        export const account = new Account(client);
        export { ID } from 'appwrite';
        ```

4. Build the login page (client component)
    - Create/replace app/page.js with this component using "use client".
    - It must render:
        - Email/password inputs
        - Name input for registration
        - Buttons: Login, Register, Logout
        - Shows "Logged in as <name>" when a session exists
    - Implement functions:
        - login(email, password): account.createEmailPasswordSession({ email, password }) then set user via account.get()
        - register(): account.create({ userId: ID.unique(), email, password, name }) then call login
        - logout(): account.deleteSession({ sessionId: 'current' }) then clear user state

5. Verify environment (ask user to confirm)
    - Confirm with the user that `.env.local` contains the correct endpoint and project ID.
    - Ensure the Web app platform exists in Appwrite Console with Hostname = `localhost`. If missing, guide the user to add it.

6. Run and test
    - Run: npm run dev
    - Open: http://localhost:3000
    - Test flows:
        - Register a new user and auto login works
        - Logout then login again
    - Surface any Appwrite errors (invalid project, endpoint, CORS/hostname) and fix by guiding updates to appwrite.js and Console settings.

7. Optional hardening
    - If the user wants TypeScript, create app/appwrite.ts and app/page.tsx with proper types.
    - Add minimal styling if requested; functionality first.

Deliverables

- A running Next.js app with working Appwrite auth (register/login/logout)
- Files created/updated: package.json (deps), app/appwrite.js, app/page.js
