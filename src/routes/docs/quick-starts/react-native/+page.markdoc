If this is your first time using Appwrite, create an account and create your first project.

Then, under **Add a platform**, add a **Android app** or a **Apple app**.

{% tabsitem #ios title="iOS" %}

Add your app **name** and **Bundle ID**. You can find your **Bundle Identifier** in the **General** tab for your app's primary target in XCode.

{% section #step-3 step=3 title="Install Appwrite" %}
Install the Appwrite SDK for React Native and required dependencies.

```sh
npm install react-native-appwrite react-native-fs react-native-url-polyfill --save
```

On iOS, you will need to install cocoapod dependencies.

```sh
cd iOS && pod install && cd ..
```

{% /section %}

{% section #step-4 step=4 title="Import Appwrite" %}
Find your project's ID in the **Settings** page. 

{% only_dark %}
![Project settings screen](/images/docs/quick-starts/dark/project-id.png)
{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}
![Project settings screen](/images/docs/quick-starts/project-id.png)
{% /only_light %}

Open `index.js` and import `react-native-url-polyfill`.

```js
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto'
```

Open `App.tsx` and add the following code to it, replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your project ID and `<YOUR_PLATFORM>` with your application id or package name.

This imports and initializes Appwrite.

```js
import { Client, Account, ID } from 'react-native-appwrite';

let client: Client;
let account: Account;

function App(): React.JSX.Element {
  const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === 'dark';

  let setupAppwrite = async () => {
    client = new Client();
    client
        .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
        .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>')
        .setPlatform('<YOUR_PLATFORM>');

    account = new Account(client);
  }
}
```
{% /section %}
{% section #step-5 step=5 title="Make first request" %}
With `Client` and `Account` service initialized, you can now make your first requests to Appwrite.

```js
let createUser = async () => {
    let user = await account.create(ID.unique(), 'example@email.com', 'strongPassword', 'Example user');
    console.log(user);
}
```

{% /section %}

{% section #step-6 step=6 title="All set" %}
Run your project with `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.
