The Appwrite SDK console is optimized with the keyboard using shortcut keys to enable accessibility.  Using shortcut keys access websites without the mouse. 

|Keys|Action|
|---|---|
|`Ctrl` + `K` or `âŒ˜` + `K`| access command center|
|`ENTER`|execute command center command|
|`Up Arrow`|scroll up the page|
|`Down Arrow`|scroll down the page|

# Shortcuts

Only in the Appwrite SDK console use these keyboard shortcuts to access Appwrite's SDK console.  Using the first letter from the call to action and the resource/product/service/page, Appwrite's keyboard shortcuts follow this pattern.  For example, the shortcut `G` then `S` goes to storage, but if you want to go to settings, the shortcut is `G` then `E` because `G` then `S` is already taken, so the next letter of settings is used.

|Shortcut|Action|
|----|----|
|Go to Auth|`G` then `A`|
|Go to Storage|`G` then `S`|
|Go to Databases|`G` then `D`|
|Go to Functions|`G` then `F`|
|Go to Projects|`G` then `P`|
|Go to Overview|`G` then `O`|
|Go to Settings|`G` then `E`|
|Go to Messaging|`G` then `M`|

The resource/product/service/page for shortcuts use the visual icons in Appwrite's website and SDK console.  For example, the shortcut for going to databases is `G` then `D`, and the icon on the keyboard matches the icon in Appwrite Databases.
