description: Learn to navigate the Appwrite Console efficiently and effectively with your keyboard or the custom Appwriter mechanical keyboard
---

The Appwrite Console was designed with a keyboard first approach. Keyboard navigation along with shortcuts provide an effective and efficient way to navigate the console and perform common actions rather quickly without the need to reach out for the mouse. These shortcuts also benefit developers relying solely on keyboards, guaranteeing an inclusive and accessible experience. Developer experience is greatly improved by virtue of the keyboard's ease of use, quick and seamless execution of essential actions and the consistency of shortcut keys.

# Accessibility  {% #accessibility %}

We are committed to making the Appwrite Console accessible to all developers by following the AA-level standards of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels). Following these standards ensures that the Console is usable by people with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. 

Good contrast between text and backgrounds, resizable text without loss of content or functionality, and navigable interfaces via keyboard and screen readers guarantee an inclusive environment and allow developers to perform their tasks efficiently. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that the Appwrite Console complies with legal requirements and promotes a positive developer experience for everyone.

# Shortcuts {% #shortcuts %}

The Appwrite Console supports keyboard shortcuts that make it easier to navigate and perform common actions quicker. The shortcuts use the following pattern: use the first letter from the call to action followed by the resource, product, service, or page you're targeting.  For example, the shortcut keys `G` + `S` navigates to the project's Storage screen. Similarly, the shortcut `G` + `F` navigates to the project's Functions screen. However, there are some exceptions. The shortcut `G` + `E` navigates to project Settings, because `G` + `S` is in use for Storage. This pattern is used to make usage of shortcuts consistent and predictable.

## Global shortcuts {% #global-shortcuts %}

Developers can also utilize global shortcuts anywhere in the Appwrite Console, allowing instant access to these features from any page on the Console.

|PC (Windows / Linux)|macOS|Action|
|----|----|----|
|`Ctrl` + `K`|`âŒ˜` + `K`|Access Command Center|


|Shortcut|Action|
|----|----|
|Set theme to light|`T` then `L`|
|Set theme to dark|`T` then `D`|
|Set theme to dark|`T` then `A`|
|Open Appwrite Assistant|`A` then `I`|

## Project shortcuts {% #project-shortcuts %}

Within the context of a project, developers can utilize project shortcuts. These shortcuts are automatically enabled once a project is selected on the Console. These shortcuts allow quick access to the project's database, storage, messaging, auth, settings, and overview pages.

|Shortcut|Action|
|----|----|
|Go to Auth|`G` then `A`|
|Go to Storage|`G` then `S`|
|Go to Databases|`G` then `D`|
|Go to Functions|`G` then `F`|
|Go to Projects|`G` then `P`|
|Go to Overview|`G` then `O`|
|Go to Messaging|`G` then `M`|
|Go to Settings|`G` then `E`|
|Create Organization|`C` then `O`|

The Appwriter is an exclusive keyboard custom-designed by the Appwrite team. It is optimized to improve developer productivity and is specially tuned to use with the Appwrite Console.

The Appwriter uses icons from the Appwrite Console and Docs on specific keys, making memorizing keyboard shortcuts easier. For example, `G` then `D` is the shortcut for navigating to your project's databases, and the icon on the `D` key matches the icon for Appwrite Databases.
