description: Learn to efficiently and effectively navigate and access the Appwrite Console with your keyboard or the Appwriter embedded with shortcuts.

The Appwrite Console is optimized with the keyboard using shortcut keys, significantly enhancing the developer's efficiency without interruption from using the mouse. These shortcut keys also benefit developers relying solely on keyboards, guaranteeing an inclusive and accessible platform. We improve developers' productivity by using the keyboard's ease of use, quick and seamless execution of essential actions, and the consistency of the shortcut key.

# Accessibility  {% #accessibility %}

We are committed to making Appwrite's platform accessible to all developers by following the AA-level standards of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels). Following these standards ensures that Appwrite's platform is usable by people with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Good contrast between text and backgrounds, resizable text without loss of content or functionality, and navigable interfaces via keyboard and screen readers guarantee an inclusive environment and allow users to perform their tasks efficiently. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that Appwrite's dashboard complies with legal requirements and promotes a positive developer experience for everyone.

# Shortcuts {% #shortcuts %}

Only in the Appwrite console can you use these keyboard shortcuts to access Appwrite's console. Appwrite's keyboard shortcuts follow the following pattern: use the first letters from the call to action and the resource, product, service, or page.  For example, using the shortcut `G,` then `S` goes to storage, but the shortcut `G` then `E` is if you want to go to settings, because `G` then `S` is already taken, so the following letter of settings.

## Global shortcuts {% #global-shortcuts %}

Appwrite users can utilize global shortcuts anywhere in the Appwrite console, allowing instant access to these features, whether on their account page or creating an organization page.

|PC (Windows)|Mac (OS)|Action|
|----|----|----|
|`Ctrl` + `K`|`⌘` + `K`|Access Command Center|


|Shortcut|Action|
|----|----|
|Set theme to light|`T` then `L`|
|Set theme to dark|`T` then `D`|
|Set theme to dark|`T` then `A`|
|Ask the AI|`A` then `I`|

## Project shortcuts {% #project-shortcuts %}

Appwrite users can utilize project shortcuts once they create a project. These shortcuts allow them to access the project's database, storage, messaging, auth, settings, and overview.

|Shortcut|Action|
|----|----|
|Go to Auth|`G` then `A`|
|Go to Storage|`G` then `S`|
|Go to Databases|`G` then `D`|
|Go to Functions|`G` then `F`|
|Go to Projects|`G` then `P`|
|Go to Overview|`G` then `O`|
|Go to Messaging|`G` then `M`|
|Go to Settings|`G` then `E`|
|Create Organization|`C` then `O`|

The Appwriter assigns Appwrite icons from the Appwrite Console and Docs to specific keys, making memorizing keyboard shortcuts easier. For example, `G` then `D` is the shortcut for going to databases, and the icon on the keyboard matches the icon in Appwrite Databases.
