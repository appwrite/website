description: Enable LLMs and code-generation tools to interact with your Appwrite project
---

Appwrite offers a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that allows LLMs to directly interact with Appwrite's API. Using our MCP server, you can use applications such as Claude Desktop apps, Cursor, and Zed to make updates to your Appwrite project.

# Install the MCP server

{% info title="Pre-requisites" %}

Before launching the MCP server, you must [setup an Appwrite project](https://cloud.appwrite.io) and create an API key with the necessary scopes enabled.

## Integrate with popular AI tools

You can integrate the MCP server with various popular AI-enabled code editors and LLM apps.

Add the MCP server to Claude Desktop
{% /cards_item %}

{% cards_item href="/docs/tooling/mcp/claude" title="Cursor" %}
Add the MCP server to Cursor
{% /cards_item %}

## Setup locally on your system

You can also setup the MCP server on your system to integrate with any apps you're developing.

### Configure environment variables

Open the terminal in your working directory and run the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #pre-requisites-linux-macos title="Linux and MacOS" %}

### Bash

```sh
export APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
export APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #pre-requisites-windows title="Windows" %}

### Command Prompt

```cmd
SET APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
SET APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
SET APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```

### Powershell

```powershell
$env:APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id";
$env:APPWRITE_API_KEY="your-api-key";
$env:APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1";
```

{% /tabsitem %}
{% /tabs %}

## Launch the server

There are two different ways by which you can launch the MCP server.

### Using uv (recommended)

{% info title="Install uv" %}

You must install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your system.

{% /info %}

Run the following command in your terminal: 

```sh
uvx mcp-server-appwrite [args]
```

### Using pip

{% info title="Install Python" %}

You must install a version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `>= 3.12` on your system.

{% /info %}

First, you must install the MCP server using `pip`:

```sh
pip install mcp-server-appwrite
```

Then, run the server:

```sh
python -m mcp_server_appwrite [args]
```

### Command-line arguments

Both the `uv` and `pip` setup processes require certain arguments to enable MCP tools for various Appwrite APIs. Please ensure you only enable the APIs you require as having too many MCPs tools enabled may cause you to exceed the context window of the LLM.

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--databases` | Enables the Databases service |
| `--users` | Enables the Users service |
| `--teams` | Enables the Teams service |
| `--storage` | Enables the Storage service |
| `--functions` | Enables the Functions service |
| `--messaging` | Enables the Messaging service |
| `--locale` | Enables the Locale service |
| `--avatars` | Enables the Avatars service |
| `--all` | Enables all Appwrite services |
