title: Model Context Protocol
description: Enable LLMs and code-generation tools to interact with your Appwrite project
---

Appwrite offers a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that allows LLMs to directly interact with Appwrite's API. Using our MCP server, you can use applications such as Claude Desktop apps, Cursor, Windsurf Editor, etc. to make updates to your Appwrite project.

# Install the MCP server

Before launching the MCP server, you must [setup an Appwrite project](https://cloud.appwrite.io) and create an API key with the necessary scopes enabled.

## Integrate with popular AI tools

You can integrate the MCP server with various popular AI-enabled code editors and LLM apps.

## Setup locally on your system

You can also setup the MCP server on your system to integrate with any apps you're developing.

### Configure environment variables

Open the terminal in your working directory and run the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #pre-requisites-linux-macos title="Linux and MacOS" %}

### Bash

```sh
export APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
export APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
export APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #pre-requisites-windows title="Windows" %}

### Command Prompt

```cmd
SET APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
SET APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
SET APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
$env:APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id";
$env:APPWRITE_API_KEY="your-api-key";
$env:APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1";
```

{% /tabsitem %}
{% /tabs %}

## Launch the server

There are two different ways by which you can launch the MCP server.

### Using uv (recommended)

{% info title="Install uv" %}

You must install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your system.

{% /info %}

Run the following command in your terminal: 

```sh
uvx mcp-server-appwrite [args]
```

### Using pip

{% info title="Install Python" %}

You must install a version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `>= 3.12` on your system.

{% /info %}

First, you must install the MCP server using `pip`:

```sh
pip install mcp-server-appwrite
```

Then, run the server:

```sh
python -m mcp_server_appwrite [args]
```

### Command-line arguments

Both the `uv` and `pip` setup processes require certain arguments to enable MCP tools for various Appwrite APIs.

{% info title="Enable only necessary MCP tools" %}

When an MCP tool is enabled, the tool's definition is passed to the LLM, using up tokens from the model's available context window. As a result, the effective context window is reduced. 

The default Appwrite MCP server ships with only the Databases tools (our most commonly used API) enabled to stay within these limits. Additional tools can be enabled by using the flags below.

{% /info %}

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--databases` | Enables the Databases API |
| `--users` | Enables the Users API |
| `--teams` | Enables the Teams API |
| `--storage` | Enables the Storage API |
| `--functions` | Enables the Functions API |
| `--messaging` | Enables the Messaging API |
| `--locale` | Enables the Locale API |
| `--avatars` | Enables the Avatars API |
| `--all` | Enables all Appwrite APIs |
