title: Model Context Protocol
description: Enable LLMs and code-generation tools to interact with your Appwrite project
---

Appwrite offers a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that allows LLMs to directly interact with Appwrite's API. Using our MCP server, you can use applications such as Claude Desktop apps, Cursor, and Zed to make updates to your Appwrite project.

Currently, the MCP server supports the following Appwrite APIs:

- [Users](/docs/references/cloud/server-python/users)
- [Databases](/docs/references/cloud/server-python/databases)

{% info title="Why are only the Users and Databases APIs available?" %}

Adding a lot of [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) to your MCP server can result in exceeding the context window of the LLM. Therefore, only the most commonly used Appwrite products have been made available currently.

If you want to use the other APIs, you can [self-host the MCP server](https://github.com/appwrite/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#local-development).

# Install the MCP server

## Pre-requisites

Before launching the MCP server, you must setup an Appwrite project and create an API key with the necessary scopes enabled.

Next, you must configure your working directory. Open your terminal and run the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #pre-requisites-linux-macos title="Linux and MacOS" %}

### Bash

```sh
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=my-project-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=my-api-key
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #pre-requisites-windows title="Windows" %}

### CMD

```cmd
SET APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=my-project-id
SET APPWRITE_API_KEY=my-api-key
SET APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
```

### Powershell

```ps
$env:APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="my-project-id";
$env:APPWRITE_API_KEY="my-api-key";
$env:APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1";
```

{% /tabsitem %}
{% /tabs %}

## Launch the server

Once your Appwrite project and API key are ready, there are two different ways by which you can setup the MCP server.

### Using `uv` (recommended)

{% info title="Install uv" %}

You must install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your system.

{% /info %}

Run the following command in your terminal: 

```sh
uvx mcp-server-appwrite
```

### Using `pip`

{% info title="Install Python" %}

You must install a version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) `>= 3.12` on your system.

{% /info %}

First, you must install the MCP server using `pip`:

```sh
pip install mcp-server-appwrite
```

Then, run the server:

```sh
python -m mcp_server_appwrite
```
