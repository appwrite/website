title: MCP server for Appwrite docs
description: Enable LLMs and code-generation tools to interact with the Appwrite docs
---

The MCP server for Appwrite documentation allows LLMs and code-generation tools to interact with comprehensive Appwrite documentation, enabling intelligent code generation for Appwrite's APIs and SDKs, troubleshooting assistance, and implementation guidance using natural language commands.

Here are some of the key benefits of using the MCP server:

- **Complete documentation access**: Provides AI assistants with access to all Appwrite documentation
- **Real-time context**: Ensures AI responses are based on the latest documentation
- **Intelligent search**: Enables semantic search across documentation content
- **Code examples**: Includes access to code samples and implementation guides
- **Best practices**: Shares recommended patterns and practices from official documentation

# Pre-requisites {% #pre-requisites %}

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and npm on your system. You can verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

# Installation {% #installation %}

# Usage {% #usage %}

Once configured, your AI assistant will have access to Appwrite documentation context. You can ask questions like:

## Example 1: Code generation

Run the following prompt in your preferred code editor/LLM after enabling the MCP server: 

```
Show me how to set up real-time subscriptions that trigger on creation of a user
```
