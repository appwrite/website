Learn how you can add the Appwrite MCP servers to agents in Zenflow to interact with both the Appwrite API and documentation.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following **pre-requisites** installed on your system:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #api-server-prerequisites title="API server" %}

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) must be installed on your system.

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #docs-server-prerequisites title="Docs server" %}

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and npm must be installed on your system.

{% /tabsitem %}
{% /tabs %}

{% section #step-1 step=1 title="Add MCP servers" %}

To add the Appwrite MCP server, open Zenflow and go to the **Settings** > **MCP servers** . From there, select your agent you want to configure MCP for, and then add your custom MCP server.

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #api-only title="API server" %}

Update the 
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {}
}
``` 
to include the API server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appwrite-api": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-appwrite",
        "--sites"
      ],
      "env": {
        "APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id",
        "APPWRITE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "APPWRITE_ENDPOINT": "https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration:**
- Replace `your-project-id` with your actual Appwrite project ID
- Replace `your-api-key` with your Appwrite API key
- Replace `<REGION>` with your Appwrite Cloud region (e.g., `nyc`, `fra`)

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #docs-only title="Docs server" %}

Update the 
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {}
}
``` 
to include the docs server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appwrite-docs": {
      "url": "https://mcp-for-docs.appwrite.io",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

{% /tabsitem %}
{% /tabs %}

Click **Save**. Once you save the configuration, Zenflow will connect with the MCP server(s) and load all available tools.

{% /section %}

{% section #step-2 step=2 title="Test the integration" %}

Open **Zenflow Chat** of your existing task to test your MCP integrations. If you don't have an existing task, you can creating one by clicking **New Task**, selecting a task type and writing a task description. Click **Create and Run**.
If you are new to Zenflow, learn more about [how to setup Zenflow](https://docs.zencoder.ai/user-guides/guides/set-up-your-zenflow#step-6:-create-your-first-task) 

You can try out the following example prompts based on the MCP server you have configured:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #test-api title="API server" %}

**Example prompts:**
- `Create a new user in my Appwrite project`
- `List all databases in my project`
- `Show me the collections in my database`
- `Create a new document in my collection`
- `Delete a specific user by ID`

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #test-docs title="Docs server" %}

**Example prompts:**
- `How do I set up real-time subscriptions in Appwrite?`
- `Show me how to authenticate users with OAuth`
- `What are the best practices for database queries?`
- `How do I implement file uploads with Appwrite Storage?`
- `Show me an example of using Appwrite Functions`
