Learn how you can add the Appwrite MCP servers to Claude Code to interact with both the Appwrite API and documentation.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following **pre-requisites** installed on your system:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #api-server-prerequisites title="API server" %}

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) must be installed on your system.

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #docs-server-prerequisites title="Docs server" %}

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and npm must be installed on your system.

{% /tabsitem %}
{% /tabs %}

{% section #step-1 step=1 title="Add MCP servers" %}

Run the following commands in your terminal to add the MCP servers:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #api-only title="API server" %}

```bash
claude mcp add-json appwrite-api '{"command":"uvx","args":["mcp-server-appwrite","--users"],"env":{"APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id", "APPWRITE_API_KEY": "your-api-key", "APPWRITE_ENDPOINT": "https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1"}}'
```

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #docs-only title="Docs server" %}

```bash
claude mcp add appwrite-docs https://mcp-for-docs.appwrite.io -t http
```

{% /tabsitem %}
{% /tabs %}

{% info title="Enable other API MCP tools" %}

To enable additional API tools, learn more about [command-line arguments](/docs/tooling/mcp/api#command-line-arguments).

{% /info %}

{% /section %}

{% section #step-2 step=2 title="Verify MCP tools" %}

Run the following command in your terminal (where Claude Code is running).

```bash
/mcp
```

You should see the added MCP servers listed there.

{% section #step-3 step=3 title="Test the integration" %}

Try out the following example prompts based on the MCP server you have configured:

{% tabs %}
{% tabsitem #test-api title="API server" %}

**Example prompts:**
- `Create a new user in my Appwrite project`
- `List all databases in my project`
- `Show me the collections in my database`
- `Create a new document in my collection`
- `Delete a specific user by ID`

{% /tabsitem %}

{% tabsitem #test-docs title="Docs server" %}

**Example prompts:**
- `How do I set up real-time subscriptions in Appwrite?`
