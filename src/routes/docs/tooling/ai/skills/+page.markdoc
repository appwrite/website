description: Install Appwrite skills to give AI agents pre-built knowledge of Appwrite SDKs and services for your preferred language.
---

Skills are open source markdown files that give AI agents deep knowledge of Appwrite SDKs and services. When installed, skills provide your AI tools with accurate, language-specific context about Appwrite APIs, so they generate correct code without needing to look up documentation. You can find all Appwrite skills on [GitHub](https://github.com/appwrite/agent-skills/).

Skills work across all major AI dev tools that support them, including Claude Code, Cursor, and other compatible agents. They are installed per-project or globally, and are available for all Appwrite client and server SDKs.

# Benefits {% #benefits %}

- **Accurate code generation**: Skills provide AI agents with correct SDK usage patterns, method signatures, and best practices for your chosen language.
- **No manual context needed**: Instead of pasting documentation into prompts, skills give agents the context they need automatically.
- **Language-specific**: Each skill is tailored to a specific SDK, so agents generate idiomatic code for your language and framework.
- **Always up to date**: Skills are maintained alongside the SDKs, so agents always have access to the latest APIs and patterns.
- **Works with any compatible agent**: Skills are not locked to a single tool. Install once and use across any AI agent that supports them.

{% section #step-3 step=3 title="Select tools" %}
Choose which AI tools should use the installed skills. This configures the skills for the agents you work with.
{% /section %}

{% section #step-4 step=4 title="Select scope" %}
Choose whether to install the skills at the **project** level or **globally**:

- **Project**: Skills are available only in the current project. This is useful when different projects use different Appwrite SDKs.
- **Global**: Skills are available across all your projects. This is useful if you use the same SDKs everywhere.
