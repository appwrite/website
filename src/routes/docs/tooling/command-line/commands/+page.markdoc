Other than commands to create and push databases, collections, functions, messaging-topics, teams, and buckets, the Appwrite CLI can be used as a Server SDK as well. The Appwrite CLI has a command for every Server API endpoint.

# Verbose {% #verbose %}
In case of errors with any command, you can get more information about what went wrong using the `--verbose` flag

```sh
appwrite users list --verbose
```

# JSON {% #json %}
By default, output is rendered in a tabular format. To format the output as JSON, use the `--json` flag.

```sh
appwrite users list --json
```

# Force {% #force %}
By default, when pushing or pulling resources, the Appwrite CLI will ask you to confirm destructive operations. Use the `--force` flag to verify all questions.

```sh
appwrite push collections --force
```

# All {% #all %}
By default, when pushing or pulling resources, Appwrite CLI would ask you to select specific resources. Use the `--all` flag to select all available options.

```sh
appwrite pull functions --all
```

# Error reporting {% #report %}
If you encounter errors with any command, you can use the --report flag to generate a GitHub reporting link.

```sh
appwrite login --report
```

# View on console {% #console-flow %}
Many resources support the option to view them in the console. Use the `--console` flag to get a direct link to the console, and add the optional `--open` flag to automatically open it in the default browser.

```sh
appwrite databases get-document \
  --database-id "<DATABASE_ID>" \
  --collection-id "<COLLECTION_ID>" \
  --document-id "<DOCUMENT_ID>" \
  --console --open
```

# Examples {% #examples %}

## Create user {% #create-user %}

To create a new user in your project, you can use the create command.

```sh
appwrite users create --user-id "unique()" \
    --email hello@appwrite.io \
    --password very_strong_password
```

## List users {% #list-users %}

To get a list of all your project users, you can use the list command.

```sh
appwrite users list
```

## List collections {% #list-collections %}

To get a list of all your [collections](/docs/tooling/command-line/collections), you can use the `list-collections` command.

```sh
appwrite databases list-collections --database-id "<DATABASE_ID>"
```

If you wish to parse the output from the CLI, you can request the CLI output in JSON format using the `--json` flag

```sh
appwrite databases list-collections --database-id "<DATABASE_ID>" --json
```

## Get collection {% #get-collection %}

To get more information on a particular collection, you can make use of the `get-collection` command and pass in the collection-id.

```sh
appwrite databases get-collection --database-id "<DATABASE_ID>" --collection-id "<COLLECTION_ID>"
```

## Create document {% #create-document %}

To create a new document in an existing collection, use the `create-document` command.

```sh
appwrite databases create-document \
    --database-id "<DATABASE_ID>" --collection-id "<COLLECTION_ID>" \
    --document-id 'unique()' --data '{ "Name": "Iron Man" }' \
    --permissions 'read("any")' 'write("team:abc")'
