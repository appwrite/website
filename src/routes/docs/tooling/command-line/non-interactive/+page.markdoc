The Appwrite CLI can be used in a non-interactive and headless manner, without saving configuration or sessions. This is especially useful when you want to automate tasks on a continuous integration server. You can enable the non-interactive mode for the Appwrite CLI by setting the `project ID`, `endpoint`, and `API Key`:

```sh
appwrite client \
    --endpoint https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1 \
    --projectId [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] \
    --key YOUR_API_KEY
```

When you set the global configuration parameters using the `appwrite client` command, they take precedence over the local configuration parameters in your `appwrite.json` thereby switching the CLI to non-interactive mode.

In this mode, the CLI can only interact with one project at a time.

# API Keys {% #api-keys %}
In non-interactive mode, the CLI uses an API key to authenticate. Your API key must have sufficient permissions to execute the commands you plan to use. [Learn more about API Keys](/docs/advanced/platform/api-keys).

# Github Actions {% #github-actions %}

gitlab, travis, genkins

# Deployment {% #deployment %}
Appwrite's deploy commands can also be executed in a non-interactive mode. This applies to both function and collection deployment.

You can deploy a function non-interactively by using the `--yes` option to skip all warnings and specifying which functions you want to deploy.

Deploy a single function by ID:

```sh
appwrite deploy function --functionId [FUNCTION ID] --yes
```

Deploy all functions:

```sh
appwrite deploy function --all --yes
```

You can deploy databases, collections, teams, and buckets non-interactively in a similar way by using the `--all` and `--yes` option.

Deploy all databases and collections:

```sh
appwrite deploy collection --all --yes
```

Deploy all teams:

```sh
appwrite deploy team --all --yes
```

Deploy all buckets:

```sh
appwrite deploy buckets --all --yes
```
