description: Efficiently deploy your Appwrite Sites using the Command-Line Tool (CLI).
---

{% partial file="cli-disclaimer.md" /%}

The CLI handles the creation, deployment, and execution of Appwrite Sites, as well as the configuration of the variables.

# Initialize site {% #initialize-site %}

Create a new site using the following command:

```sh
appwrite init sites
```

# Pull site {% #pull-site %}

You can also pull your existing Appwrite Sites from the Appwrite Console using the `pull` command in the folder containing your `appwrite.config.json` file.

```sh
appwrite pull sites
```

# appwrite.config.json {% #appwritejson %}

After [initializing](/docs/tooling/command-line/installation#initialization) your Appwrite project and pulling your existing sites, your `appwrite.config.json` file should look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "projectId": "<PROJECT_ID>",
    "endpoint": "https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1",
    "sites": [
        {
            "$id": "<SITE_ID>",
            "name": "Documentation template",
            "enabled": true,
            "logging": true,
            "framework": "astro",
            "timeout": 30,
            "installCommand": "npm install",
            "buildCommand": "npm run build",
            "outputDirectory": "./dist",
            "specification": "s-1vcpu-512mb",
            "buildRuntime": "node-22",
            "adapter": "ssr",
            "fallbackFile": "",
            "path": "sites/documentation-template"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Push site {% #push-site %}

{% partial file="cli-push-command.md" /%}

```sh
appwrite push sites
```

# Commands {% #commands %}

The functions command lets you view, create, and manage your Appwrite Sites. Appwrite Sites CLI commands generally follow the following syntax:

```sh
appwrite sites [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```
