description: Efficiently deploy your Appwrite topics using the Command-Line Tool (CLI). 
---

{% partial file="cli-disclaimer.md" /%}

The Appwrite CLI can create, update, delete, and get topics, as well as configure the provider and the subscribers.

# Initialize topic {% #initialize-topic %}

Create a new topic using the following command:

```
appwrite init topics
```

# Pull topics {% #pull-topics %}

You can also pull your existing Appwrite topics from the Appwrite Console using the `pull` command in the folder containing your `appwrite.config.json` file.

```sh
appwrite pull topics
```

# appwrite.config.json {% #appwritejson %}

After [initializing](/docs/tooling/command-line/installation#initialization) your Appwrite project and pulling your existing topics, your `appwrite.config.json` file should look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "projectId": "<PROJECT_ID>",
    "topics": [
        {
            "$id": "N1IzUIJiOicGbhJye",
            "$createdAt": "2024-07-01T14:40:43.381+00:00",
            "$updatedAt": "2024-07-01T14:40:43.381+00:00",
            "name": "Anime",
            "emailTotal": 3,
            "smsTotal": 0,
            "pushTotal": 0,
            "subscribe": [
                "users"
            ]
        },
        {
            "$id": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1N",
            "$createdAt": "2024-07-01T14:41:19.029+00:00",
            "$updatedAt": "2024-07-01T14:41:28.751+00:00",
            "name": "Music",
            "emailTotal": 2,
            "smsTotal": 0,
            "pushTotal": 0,
            "subscribe": [
                "users",
                "any"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

# Push topics {% #push-topics %}

{% partial file="cli-push-command.md" /%}

```sh
appwrite push topics
```

# Commands {% #commands %}

The messaging command allows you to send, get, update, and delete push notifications, SMS text messages, and emails. You can create a new provider like Mailgun and SendGrid and create, update, get, and delete topics and subscribers. Appwrite messaging CLI commands generally follow the following syntax:
```sh
appwrite messaging [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```
