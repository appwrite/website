The Appwriter is an exclusive mechanical keyboard custom-designed by the Appwrite team. It is optimized to improve developer productivity and is specially tuned to use with the Appwrite Console.

The Appwriter uses icons from the Appwrite Console and Docs on specific keys, making memorizing keyboard shortcuts easier. For example, `G` then `D` is the shortcut for navigating to your project's databases, and the icon on the `D` key matches the icon for Appwrite Databases.

# Quick start  {% #quick-start %}

There are currently three modes to connect the Appwriter to the computer: wired, wireless, and Bluetooth.

## Wired mode {% #wired-mode %}

Make sure to use the USB-TYPE-C data cable to connect the computer to the keyboard and push the Appwriter switch towards the T. When connecting the Appwriter for the first time using the wired mode, your computer will install all required drivers by itself upon connection.

While the Appwriter is connected through the wired mode, its battery will charge, but make sure to use a charger that doesn't exceed a voltage/current = DSCV = 1A (max). Using a charger that exceeds this voltage and current ratings could easily damage your Appwriter keyboard.

## Wireless mode {% #wireless-mode %}

Make sure to push the Appwriter switch towards the G. Upon doing this, long press the `FN` + `4` keys for around 3 seconds. After the `4` key light flashes quickly, plug the receiver into a USB port of your computer.

## Bluetooth mode {% #bluetooth-mode %}

push switch to b, short FN + switch bluetooth key position

bluetooth paring: long press and hold fn+1 and wait for 1 key to indicate fast light
after flashing quickly, search for elements and successfully pair bluetooth
it can be used by B (2/3 key position operation in the same as above)
