Permissions define who can access documents in a collection. By default **no permissions** are granted to any users, so no user can access any documents.
Permissions exist at two levels, collection level and document level permissions.

In Appwrite, permissions are **granted**, meaning a user has no access by default and receive access when granted.
A user with access granted at either collection level or document level will be able to access a document.
Users **don't need access at both levels** to access documents.

# Collection level {% #collection-level %}

Collection level permissions apply to every document in the collection.
If a user has read, create, update, or delete permissions at the collection level, the user can access **all documents** inside the collection.

Configure collection level permissions by navigating to **Your collection** > **Settings** > **Permissions**.

# Document level {% #document-level %}

Document level permissions grant access to individual documents.
If a user has read, create, update, or delete permissions at the document level, the user can access the **individual document**.

Document level permissions are only applied if Document Security is enabled in the settings of your collection.
Enable document level permissions by navigating to **Your collection** > **Settings** > **Document security**.

Document level permissions are configured in individual documents.
