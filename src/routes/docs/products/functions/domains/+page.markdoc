title: Domains
description: Execute Appwrite Functions through domains using standard HTTP GET, POST, or other request methods to serve static, JSON, HTML, or other content.
---

Each deployed function can have its own domain, generated or developer defined.
You can use this domain to execute Appwrite Functions through HTTP methods.
You can use common practices like using paths, query parameters, headers, HTTP methods, formdata,
and all the typical HTTP concepts to implement Appwrite Functions.

Appwrite generates TLS certificates to enforce HTTPS on all Appwrite Functions domains, generated or custom.
These domains are safe to use and access in production.

# Generated domains {% #generated-domains %}

Each function automatically receives a region-specific domain that's ready to use immediately after deployment.

1. In the Appwrite Console's sidebar, click **Functions**.
1. Under the **Domains** tab, you'll find the generated domain from Appwrite.

The generated domain uses the `appwrite.run` format, which executes your function directly in the region where it is deployed.

```text
https://<ID>.<REGION>.appwrite.run
```

For example, a function deployed in the Frankfurt region would have a domain like:

```text
https://67abc12def3456.fra.appwrite.run
```

# Edge network domain {% #edge-network-domain %}

You can add an `appwrite.network` domain to your function to take advantage of Appwrite's edge network. The `appwrite.network` domain routes requests to the nearest region based on the user's geographic location, reducing latency for globally distributed users.

To add an edge network domain:

1. Navigate to the Appwrite Console's **Functions** page.
2. Navigate to the **Domains** tab.
3. Click on **Create domain** and add the `appwrite.network` domain to your function.

The edge network domain uses the following format:

```text
https://<ID>.appwrite.network
```

## Region vs edge {% #region-vs-edge %}

| Domain | Routing | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `<ID>.<REGION>.appwrite.run` | Executes directly in the deployed region | Compute-intensive tasks, data-heavy operations, consistent regional performance |
| `<ID>.appwrite.network` | Routes to the nearest region via edge network | Latency-sensitive operations, globally distributed users |

# Add a custom domain {% #add-a-custom-domain %}

1. Navigate to the Appwrite Console's **Functions** page.
2. Navigate to the **Domains** tab.
3. Click on **Create domain**.
4. Input your domain and click **Next**.
5. Copy the **CNAME** record and add it to your domain registrar.
6. Click **Go to console** and wait for verification and certificate generation.

DNS records can take up to 48 hours to propagate.

When both **VERIFICATION STATUS** and **CERTIFICATE STATUS** are green, the new domain is ready to use.
