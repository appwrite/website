Appwrite provides a variety of Function Templates to help you jump start your function development.
You can use Appwrite Function Templates as examples or boilerplates to add new functionality to your Appwrite project.

# Find templates {% #find-templates %}
You can find all available templates by navigating to the Appwrite Console, under your project > **Functions** > **Templates**.

{% only_dark %}

{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}
![Templates screen](/images/docs/functions/templates/templates.png)
{% /only_light %}

You can filter functions by searching, filter by use case, or filter by runtime.
Click **Create function** to create a function from a template.

# Create with templates {% #create-with-templates %}

The create function wizard has five steps.

## Configuration {% #configuration %}
Pick a display name for your function and an ID. You will later use the ID to programmatically execute or configure the function.
Pick the runtime language you wish the function to be created in, not all runtimes are available for all templates.

## Variables {% #variables %}
Appwrite Functions uses [environment variables](/docs/products/functions/develop#environment-variables)
to pass constants and secrets to your Appwrite Functions. You'll provide information like API keys and other
secrets to integrations in this step. If you need an Appwrite API key, you'll be propted to generate one.

## Connect {% #connect %}
You can choose to clone a new repository to your GitHub profile or organization, or to connect to an existing repository.

If you choose connect to an existing repository, the function's code will be cloned to the root folder
you specify under the **Branch** step.

## Repository {% #repository %}
Configure the connected respository for your Appwrite Function. This will be the repository
holding the source code for your function. When the code in this repository is updated, new 
deployments will be created.

## Branch {% #branch %}
Production branch specifies the branch connected to your Appwrite Function. When new commits are made to
this branch, a new deployment is automatically created and deployed.

The root directory specifies the folder holding your function template's code.

When a PR is made to the branch, a new deployment is built, but not activated.
A comment is made to your PR about the build, unless you enable **Silent mode**.

# Available templates {% #available-templates %}
You can explore these templates, along with many more, in Appwrite’s [Functions Templates](https://github.com/appwrite/templates) repository on GitHub as well.
