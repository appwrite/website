{% section #step-1 step=1 title="Create React Native app" %}

First, you must either create a React Native app or setup the [React Native starter template](https://github.com/appwrite/templates-for-sites).

Open your terminal, and run the following command.

```bash
npx create-expo-app my-app
```

Once the app is created, navigate to the project directory, open the `package.json` file and add the following line under `scripts`:

```json
"build": "expo export --platform web"
```

Push this project to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/new).

{% section #step-3 step=3 title="Create site" %}
Head to the **Sites** page in your Appwrite project, click on the **Create site** button, and select **Connect a repository**.

Connect your GitHub account and select the repository you intend to deploy.

1. Select the **production branch** and **root directory** from your repo.
2. Verify that the **correct framework** is selected. In case an incorrect framework is visible, pick **React Native** from the drop-down list. 
3. Confirm the **install command**, **build command**, and **output directory** in the build settings. The default build settings for React Native are:
    - **Install command:** `npm install`
    - **Build command:** `npm run build`
    - **Output directory:** `./dist`
4. Add any **environment variables** required by the site.

Click on the **Deploy** button.
