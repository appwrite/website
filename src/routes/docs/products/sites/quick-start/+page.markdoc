# Start with Sites

You can create and execute your first Appwrite Site in minutes.

# Create site

Before deploying your web app with Git, create a new Site attached to your GitHub repository.

{% only_dark %}
![Create site wizard](/images/docs/sites/dark/create-site-wizard.png)
{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}
![Create site wizard](/images/docs/sites/create-site-wizard.png)
{% /only_light %}

1. In the Appwrite Console's sidebar, click **Sites**.
2. Click on the **Create site** button.
3. After clicking on **Connect Git repository**, select your repository.
4. After connecting to GitHub, (optionally) add a name and site ID.
5. Verify that the correct framework is selected.
6. Confirm the install command, build command, and output directory in the build settings. Visit your preferred [framework quick-start](#framework-quick-starts) to learn more.
7. Add any environment variables required by the site.
6. The site will be created, and a build will begin. Once the build is completed, you'll have created your first site. You can use your site's **domain** to access the deployment.
