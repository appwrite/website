# Migration process

Follow these steps to move your application from Vercel to Appwrite Sites.

{% section id="create-project" step=1 title="Create an Appwrite project" %}
Start by setting up a new project in Appwrite:

1. Sign in to the [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Click **Create Project**
3. Enter a name for your project and click **Create**

Your new project will serve as the container for your migrated site and any other Appwrite services you might need.
{% /section %}

{% section id="connect-repo" step=2 title="Connect your repository" %}
Next, create a new site by connecting your existing repository:

1. In your Appwrite project, select **Sites** from the sidebar
2. Click **Create Site**
3. Select **Connect a repository**
4. Authenticate with GitHub
5. Select the repository containing your Vercel project
6. Choose your production branch (typically `main`)

Appwrite will auto-detect your framework. Verify this is correct or select manually from the dropdown menu.
{% /section %}

# Configure your domain

One of the differences between Vercel and Appwrite is how they handle domain configuration for apex domains. Vercel uses A records for apex domains, while Appwrite uses nameserver (NS) records. This means you'll need to delegate DNS management to Appwrite.

# Migrating an apex domain

{% section id="prepare-vercel-domain" step=1 title="Prepare your Vercel domain" %}
Before migrating, document your current Vercel DNS configuration:

1. In Vercel, go to project settings > Domains
2. Note any custom DNS records you've configured (MX, TXT, etc.)
3. Don't remove the domain from Vercel until Appwrite is fully configured
{% /section %}

{% section id="add-apex-domain" step=2 title="Add domain to Appwrite Sites" %}
Add your apex domain to your Appwrite site:

1. Navigate to your site > **Domains** tab
2. Click **Add domain**
3. Enter your apex domain (e.g., `example.com`)
4. Select **Active deployment** as the domain rule type
5. Note the NS records Appwrite provides:
   - `ns1.appwrite.zone`
   - `ns2.appwrite.zone`
{% /section %}

{% section id="update-nameservers" step=3 title="Update nameservers at your registrar" %}
At your domain registrar:

1. Update your domain's nameservers to point to Appwrite's nameservers
2. If you had custom DNS records in Vercel (like MX records for email), you'll need to recreate these in Appwrite's DNS configuration

{% info title="Important DNS change note" %}
Changing nameservers delegates your entire domain's DNS management to Appwrite. DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate.
{% /info %}
{% /section %}

# Migrating a subdomain

For subdomains, both Vercel and Appwrite use CNAME records, making the migration process simpler.

{% section id="add-subdomain" step=1 title="Add subdomain to Appwrite Sites" %}
1. Navigate to your site > **Domains** tab
2. Click **Add domain**
3. Enter your subdomain (e.g., `www.example.com`)
4. Select **Active deployment** as the domain rule type
5. Copy the CNAME value provided by Appwrite
{% /section %}

{% section id="update-dns-records" step=2 title="Update DNS records" %}
At your domain registrar or DNS provider:

1. Create or update the CNAME record for your subdomain
2. Point it to the value provided by Appwrite
3. Wait for DNS propagation and verification
{% /section %}

# Domain rule types

When adding a domain in Appwrite, you can choose from three rule types: Active deployment, Git branch, or Redirect.

{% /arrow_link %}


# Configure build settings

After setting up your project and domain, you'll need to configure your build settings to match your Vercel configuration.

{% section id="build-settings" step=1 title="Set up build configuration" %}
Navigate to your site > **Settings** > **Build settings** and configure the following:

- **Framework:** Appwrite will attempt to automatically detect your framework. Verify and ensure it is the same framework as in Vercel.
- **Install command:** Enter the same install command from Vercel
- **Build command:** Enter the same build command from Vercel
- **Output directory:** Enter the same output directory from Vercel
- **Root directory:** If your app is in a monorepo subdirectory, specify the path
- **Rendering:** Select the appropriate rendering mode (Static or SSR)

# Framework defaults

Appwrite automatically detects and applies default settings for popular frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Angular, and Astro.

# Manage environment variables

Environment variables require special attention during migration, as they control how your application behaves in different environments.

{% section id="gather-env-vars" step=1 title="Gather variables from Vercel" %}
Before migrating, document all your Vercel environment variables:

1. In Vercel, go to your project settings > **Environment Variables**
2. Document all variables, noting which are for development, preview, or production
3. Identify any system variables your application relies on

{% info title="System variables" %}
Vercel automatically provides system variables like `VERCEL_URL`. You'll need to adapt your code to use Appwrite's equivalent system variables.
{% /info %}
{% /section %}

{% section id="set-env-vars" step=2 title="Set variables in Appwrite" %}
1. Navigate to your site > **Settings** > **Environment variables**
2. Click the **plus (+)** icon to add a new variable
3. Enter the key and value for each variable. You can optionally import a `.env` file.
4. Toggle **Secret** for sensitive variables that should be hidden

{% /only_light %}
{% /section %}

# Appwrite system variables
Appwrite automatically injects these variables into your site:

{% partial file="sites-env-vars.md" /%}

# Handle redirects and rewrites

One key difference between Vercel and Appwrite is how they handle redirects and rewrites.

{% info title="Key difference" %}
Vercel offers platform-level path redirects configured in `vercel.json`, while Appwrite provides domain-level redirects through the Domains tab and supports framework-level path redirects through your application code.
{% /info %}

{% section id="domain-redirects" step=1 title="Domain-level redirects" %}
Appwrite's domain-level redirects are configured in the Domains tab of your site:

1. Navigate to your site > **Domains** tab
2. Click **Add domain** or select an existing domain
3. Choose **Redirect** as the domain rule type
4. Enter the destination URL and select an appropriate HTTP status code (301, 302, 303, 307, or 308)

Domain redirects in Appwrite do not preserve path or query parameters. For example, if you redirect `example.com` to `appwrite.io`, then `example.com/docs?id=123` will redirect to `appwrite.io` (not `appwrite.io/docs?id=123`).
{% /section %}

{% section id="framework-redirects" step=2 title="Framework-level redirects" %}
For path-based redirects, use your framework's built-in functionality:

# Next.js
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/old-path',
        destination: '/new-path',
        permanent: true, // 308 status code
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

# SvelteKit
```javascript
// src/routes/+layout.server.js
export function load({ url }) {
  if (url.pathname === '/old-path') {
    return {
      status: 301,
      redirect: '/new-path'
    };
  }
}
```

# Nuxt
```javascript
// nuxt.config.js
export default {
  router: {
    extendRoutes(routes, resolve) {
      routes.push({
        path: '/old-path',
        redirect: {
          to: '/new-path',
          statusCode: 301
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```
{% /section %}

# Migrate serverless functions

There are two approaches to serverless functions when migrating from Vercel to Appwrite:

{% info title="Framework API routes vs. standalone functions" %}
When using frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, or SvelteKit with SSR enabled, your API routes will work natively within Appwrite Sites, just as they do in Vercel. For standalone serverless functions or more complex use cases, you can use [Appwrite Functions](/docs/functions).
{% /info %}

{% section id="framework-api-routes" step=1 title="Framework API routes" %}
For frameworks with built-in API routes:

1. **Next.js**: API routes in `/pages/api` or route handlers in `/app/api` work natively
2. **Nuxt**: Server API endpoints work as expected
3. **SvelteKit**: Server routes and API endpoints function normally

No migration is needed for these framework-native API routes - they'll work automatically when you deploy your site with SSR enabled.
{% /section %}

{% section id="standalone-functions" step=2 title="Standalone Appwrite Functions" %}
For standalone serverless functions or more complex use cases:

1. In your Appwrite project, go to **Functions**
2. Click **Create Function**
3. Select a runtime that matches your needs (Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, etc.)
4. Create your function code
5. Deploy your function
{% /section %}

{% arrow_link href="/docs/products/functions/quick-start" %}
Learn how to create and deploy functions
{% /arrow_link %}

{% section id="update-endpoints" step=3 title="API endpoints usage" %}

# Framework API routes
When using framework API routes within Appwrite Sites (with SSR enabled), your endpoints remain the same:

- Vercel: `/api/hello`
- Appwrite Sites: `/api/hello` (no change needed)

Your existing API routes code will work without modification:

```javascript
// /api/hello.js in Next.js (works the same in both Vercel and Appwrite Sites)
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello!' });
}
```

# Standalone Appwrite Functions
If you're using standalone Appwrite Functions (outside your site's codebase), you'll need to update your frontend code to use the Appwrite Functions API:

```javascript
// Calling an Appwrite Function from your frontend
import { Client, Functions } from 'appwrite';

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('your-project-id');

const functions = new Functions(client);

const response = await functions.createExecution('your-function-id');
```
{% /section %}

# Handle middleware

While Vercel offers platform-level Edge Middleware configured through `vercel.json`, Appwrite Sites fully supports framework-native middleware when using SSR. This means your existing middleware code will continue to work without modification.

{% section id="framework-middleware" step=1 title="Framework-native middleware" %}
# Next.js
```javascript
// middleware.js
export function middleware(request) {
  // Your middleware logic
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/path/:path*',
};
```

# SvelteKit
```javascript
// src/hooks.server.js
export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
  // Your middleware logic before response
  const response = await resolve(event);
  // Your middleware logic after response
  return response;
}
```

# Nuxt
```javascript
// server/middleware/example.js
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  // Your middleware logic
});
```
{% /section %}

# Next steps

After completing your migration from Vercel to Appwrite Sites, we recommend:

1. **Test thoroughly** - Verify all routes, functionality, and environment-specific features
2. **Monitor performance** - Check that your site performs as expected on Appwrite
3. **Set up CI/CD** - Appwrite already provides git integration and deployment workflows, but you can also use GitHub Actions or any other CI/CD tool to automate your deployments.
4. **Explore Appwrite services** - Consider integrating with other Appwrite services like [Authentication](/docs/products/auth), [Databases](/docs/products/databases), and [Storage](/docs/products/storage)

# Conclusion

This guide has outlined the key steps for migrating from Vercel to Appwrite Sites. You'll find that Git integration and deployment workflows remain largely familiar, making these aspects of migration more approachable for most projects.

While domain configuration and platform-specific features like middleware require some adaptation, the framework-native approaches detailed in this guide help ensure a smooth transition.
