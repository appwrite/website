description: Safely revert a site to a previous deployment using instant rollbacks.
---

If a site needs to be reverted to a previously functional state for any reason (runtime errors, security flaw, etc.), you can roll your site back to an existing ready deployment.

Instant rollbacks don't delete, modify,or re-deploy your code. Instead, they simply change which deployment is being served to visitors. This makes rollbacks near-instantaneous, with zero downtime.

# Use instant rollbacks

To use the instant rollback feature, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your site on Appwrite Console.
2. Under the **Overview** tab, click on the **Instant Rollback** button.
3. Once the modal opens, click on the **Rollback** button.

{% /only_light %}

This will allow you to select a previously active, ready deployment to promote to currently active state.
