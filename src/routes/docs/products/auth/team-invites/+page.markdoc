description: Learn how to manage team invites in Appwrite. Implement both client-side email invites and server-side custom flows for team memberships.
---

Appwrite provides two approaches for adding members to teams: client-side email invites and server-side custom flows. Each approach serves different use cases and offers unique benefits.

# Invite client-side

Client-side email invites are perfect for implementing user-to-user invitations, allowing your users to invite others to join their teams, organizations, or shared resources. When creating a membership, Appwrite:
1. Creates a new user account if one doesn't exist for the email address
2. Sends an automated email invitation to the user
3. Creates a pending membership
4. Activates the membership when the user accepts

Client-side invites are ideal when you want a simple, automated process that lets your users manage their own team invitations.
Appwrite handles the email delivery with built-in templates and localization support, making it easy to implement a standard invite acceptance flow with email verification.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client, Teams } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const teams = new Teams(client);

// Create membership with email invite
const membership = await teams.createMembership(
    '<TEAM_ID>',
    ['developer'],     // roles
    'user@example.com', // email
    undefined,         // userId (optional)
    undefined,         // phone (optional)
    'https://yourapp.com/accept-invite' // url - redirect after email click
);
```
```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final teams = Teams(client);

// Create membership with email invite
final membership = await teams.createMembership(
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>',
    roles: ['developer'],
    email: 'user@example.com',
    url: 'https://yourapp.com/accept-invite' // redirect after email click
);
```
```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1") // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>") // Your project ID

let teams = Teams(client)

// Create membership with email invite
let membership = try await teams.createMembership(
    teamId: "<TEAM_ID>",
    roles: ["developer"],
    email: "user@example.com",
    url: "https://yourapp.com/accept-invite" // redirect after email click
)
```
```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Teams

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1") // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>") // Your project ID

val teams = Teams(client)

// Create membership with email invite
val response = teams.createMembership(
    teamId = "<TEAM_ID>",
    roles = listOf("developer"),
    email = "user@example.com",
    url = "https://yourapp.com/accept-invite" // redirect after email click
)
```
{% /multicode %}

## Accept invitations

For client-side email invites, users must accept the invitation to join the team. The acceptance flow:
1. User receives an email with an invitation link containing a secret token
2. Clicking the link redirects to your app
3. Your app calls the acceptance endpoint
4. Upon success, the user gains immediate access

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client, Teams } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const teams = new Teams(client);

// Accept the invitation using the membership ID and secret
const response = await teams.updateMembershipStatus(
    '<TEAM_ID>',
    '<MEMBERSHIP_ID>',
    '<USER_ID>',
    '<SECRET>'
);
```
```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final teams = Teams(client);

// Accept the invitation using the membership ID and secret
final response = await teams.updateMembershipStatus(
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>',
    membershipId: '<MEMBERSHIP_ID>',
    userId: '<USER_ID>',
    secret: '<SECRET>'
);
```
```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let teams = Teams(client)

// Accept the invitation using the membership ID and secret
let response = try await teams.updateMembershipStatus(
    teamId: "<TEAM_ID>",
    membershipId: "<MEMBERSHIP_ID>",
    userId: "<USER_ID>",
    secret: "<SECRET>"
)
```
```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Teams

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val teams = Teams(client)

// Accept the invitation using the membership ID and secret
val response = teams.updateMembershipStatus(
    teamId = "<TEAM_ID>",
    membershipId = "<MEMBERSHIP_ID>",
    userId = "<USER_ID>",
    secret = "<SECRET>"
)
```
{% /multicode %}

# Server-side custom flows

Server-side membership creation bypasses the email invitation process, allowing direct member addition. This approach:
1. Creates an active membership immediately
2. Doesn't require user acceptance
3. Gives you complete control over the invitation workflow

This makes them perfect for scenarios requiring custom workflows, such as bulk user management, automated team assignments, or integration with external systems.
Since memberships are created directly, users gain immediate access without waiting for email acceptance.

```server-nodejs
const sdk = require('node-appwrite');

const client = new sdk.Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')
    .setKey('<API_KEY>');

const teams = new sdk.Teams(client);

// Create membership directly with userId
const membership = await teams.createMembership(
    '<TEAM_ID>',
    ['developer'],
    '<USER_ID>',
    'John Doe'  // optional name
);
```

teams = Teams(client)

# Create membership directly with userId

    team_id='<TEAM_ID>',
    roles=['developer'],

```
```server-swift

```

# Manage memberships

Once team memberships are created, you'll need to manage their lifecycle. This includes checking status, updating roles, and removing members when necessary.

## Check membership status

Before performing actions on team memberships, you often need to verify a user's current status within a team. The process differs between client-side and server-side implementations.

### Client-side
To check membership status client-side, first list the teams and then get the memberships for a specific team:

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client, Teams } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const teams = new Teams(client);

// Get list of teams the user is part of
const teamsList = await teams.list();

// For a specific team, get all memberships
const response = await teams.listMemberships({
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>'
});

// Find membership for specific user
const userMembership = response.memberships.find(
    membership => membership.userId === '<USER_ID>'
);

if (userMembership) {
    console.log(userMembership.confirm); // false = invited, true = joined
    console.log(userMembership.roles); // ['developer', etc]
}
```
```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final teams = Teams(client);

// Get list of teams the user is part of
final teamsList = await teams.list();

// For a specific team, get all memberships
final response = await teams.listMemberships(
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>'
);

// Find membership for specific user
final userMembership = response.memberships.firstWhere(
    (membership) => membership.userId == '<USER_ID>',
    orElse: () => null
);

if (userMembership != null) {
    print(userMembership.confirm); // false = invited, true = joined
    print(userMembership.roles); // ['developer', etc]
}
```
```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let teams = Teams(client)

// Get list of teams the user is part of
let teamsList = try await teams.list()

// For a specific team, get all memberships
let response = try await teams.listMemberships(
    teamId: "<TEAM_ID>"
)

// Find membership for specific user
if let userMembership = response.memberships.first(where: { $0.userId == "<USER_ID>" }) {
    print(userMembership.confirm) // false = invited, true = joined
    print(userMembership.roles) // ['developer', etc]
}
```
```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Teams

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val teams = Teams(client)

// Get list of teams the user is part of
val teamsList = teams.list()

// For a specific team, get all memberships
val response = teams.listMemberships(
    teamId = "team_id"
)

// Find membership for specific user
val userMembership = response.memberships.find {
    it.userId == "<USER_ID>"
}

userMembership?.let {
    println(it.confirm) // false = invited, true = joined
    println(it.roles) // ['developer', etc]
}
```
{% /multicode %}

### Server-side
Server-side requires iterating through teams and memberships since the data isn't filtered for a specific user:

{% multicode %}
```server-nodejs
const sdk = require('node-appwrite');

const client = new sdk.Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')
    .setKey('<API_KEY>');

const teams = new sdk.Teams(client);

// Get all teams
const teamsList = await teams.list();

// Iterate through teams to find memberships
for (const team of teamsList.teams) {
    const response = await teams.listMemberships({
        teamId: team.$id
    });

    // Find membership for specific user
    const userMembership = response.memberships.find(
        membership => membership.userId === '<USER_ID>'
    );

    if (userMembership) {
        console.log(`Team: ${team.name}`);
        console.log(`Joined: ${userMembership.joined}`); // null if invited, timestamp if joined
        console.log(`Roles: ${userMembership.roles}`);
    }
}
```
```server-python
from appwrite.client import Client
from appwrite.services.teams import Teams

client = Client()
client.set_endpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
client.set_project('<PROJECT_ID>')
client.set_key('<API_KEY>')

teams = Teams(client)

// Get all teams
teams_list = teams.list()

// Iterate through teams to find memberships
for team in teams_list['teams']:
    response = teams.list_memberships(team['$id'])

    // Find membership for specific user
    user_membership = next(
        (m for m in response['memberships'] if m['userId'] == '<USER_ID>'),
        None
    )

    if user_membership:
        print(f"Team: {team['name']}")
        print(f"Joined: {user_membership['joined']}") # null if invited, timestamp if joined
        print(f"Roles: {user_membership['roles']}")
```
```server-swift
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")
    .setKey("<API_KEY>")

let teams = Teams(client)

// Get all teams
let teamsList = try await teams.list()

// Iterate through teams to find memberships
for team in teamsList.teams {
    let response = try await teams.listMemberships(
        teamId: team.$id
    )

    // Find membership for specific user
    if let userMembership = response.memberships.first(where: { $0.userId == "<USER_ID>" }) {
        print("Team: \(team.name)")
        print("Joined: \(userMembership.joined)") # null if invited, timestamp if joined
        print("Roles: \(userMembership.roles)")
    }
}
```
```server-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Teams

val client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")
    .setKey("<API_KEY>")

val teams = Teams(client)

// Get all teams
val teamsList = teams.list()

// Iterate through teams to find memberships
teamsList.teams.forEach { team ->
    val response = teams.listMemberships(teamId = team.$id)

    // Find membership for specific user
    val userMembership = response.memberships.find {
        it.userId == "<USER_ID>"
    }

    userMembership?.let {
        println("Team: ${team.name}")
        println("Joined: ${it.joined}") # null if invited, timestamp if joined
        println("Roles: ${it.roles}")
    }
}
```
{% /multicode %}

## Remove members

Team owners can remove members or users can leave teams:

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client, Teams } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const teams = new Teams(client);

await teams.deleteMembership(
    '<TEAM_ID>',
    '<MEMBERSHIP_ID>'
);
```
```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final teams = Teams(client);

await teams.deleteMembership(
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>',
    membershipId: '<MEMBERSHIP_ID>'
);
```
```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let teams = Teams(client)

try await teams.deleteMembership(
    teamId: "<TEAM_ID>",
    membershipId: "<MEMBERSHIP_ID>"
)
```
```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Teams

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val teams = Teams(client)

teams.deleteMembership(
    teamId = "<TEAM_ID>",
    membershipId = "<MEMBERSHIP_ID>"
)
```
{% /multicode %}

# Manage team permissions

Teams in Appwrite use a role-based access control (RBAC) system. Each team member can be assigned one or more roles that define their permissions within the team.

## Update roles

You can assign roles when creating a membership or update them later. Note that only team members with the owner role can update other members' roles:

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client, Teams } from "appwrite"

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')

const teams = new Teams(client)

// Update member roles
await teams.updateMembership(
    '<TEAM_ID>',
    '<MEMBERSHIP_ID>',
    ['admin', 'developer']
)
```
```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart'

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')

final teams = Teams(client)

// Update member roles
await teams.updateMembership(
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>',
    membershipId: '<MEMBERSHIP_ID>',
    roles: ['admin', 'developer']
)
```
```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let teams = Teams(client)

// Update member roles
try await teams.updateMembership(
    teamId: "<TEAM_ID>",
    membershipId: "<MEMBERSHIP_ID>",
    roles: ["admin", "developer"]
)
```
```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Teams

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val teams = Teams(client)

// Update member roles
teams.updateMembership(
    teamId = "<TEAM_ID>",
    membershipId = "<MEMBERSHIP_ID>",
    roles = listOf("admin", "developer")
)
```
{% /multicode %}

## Check role access

You can verify if a user has specific roles:

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client, Teams } from "appwrite"

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')

const teams = new Teams(client)

// Get team memberships
const response = await teams.listMemberships({
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>'
});

// Check if user has specific role
const membership = response.memberships.find(m => m.userId === '<USER_ID>')
const isAdmin = membership?.roles.includes('admin') ?? false
```
```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart'

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>')

final teams = Teams(client)

// Get team memberships
final response = await teams.listMemberships(
    teamId: '<TEAM_ID>'
)

// Check if user has specific role
final membership = response.memberships.firstWhere(
    (m) => m.userId == '<USER_ID>',
    orElse: () => null
)
final isAdmin = membership?.roles.contains('admin') ?? false
```
```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let teams = Teams(client)

// Get team memberships
let response = try await teams.listMemberships(
    teamId: "<TEAM_ID>"
)

// Check if user has specific role
let membership = response.memberships.first { $0.userId == "<USER_ID>" }
let isAdmin = membership?.roles.contains("admin") ?? false
```
```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Teams

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val teams = Teams(client)

// Get team memberships
val response = teams.listMemberships(
    teamId = "<TEAM_ID>"
)

// Check if user has specific role
val membership = response.memberships.find { it.userId == "<USER_ID>" }
val isAdmin = membership?.roles?.contains("admin") ?: false
```
