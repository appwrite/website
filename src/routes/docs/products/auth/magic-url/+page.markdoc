title: Magic URL login
description: Add magic URL to your authentication in Appwrite. Explore the convenience of passwordless login and email-based authentication using magic links.
---

Magic URL is a password-less way to authenticate users. When a user logs in by providing their email, they will receive an email with a "magic" link that contains a secret used to log in the user. The user can simply click the link to be logged in.

# Send email {% #init %}

Initialize the log in process with the [Create Magic URL Token](/docs/references/cloud/client-web/account#createMagicURLToken) route. If the email has never been used, a **new account is generated**, then the user will receive an email. If the email is already attached to an account, the **user ID is ignored** and the user will receive a link in their email.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client, Account, ID } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>'); // Your project ID

const account = new Account(client);

const token = await account.createMagicURLToken(ID.unique(), 'email@example.com');
```

```graphql
mutation {
    accountCreateMagicURLToken(
        userId: "ID.unique()",
        email: "email@example.com"
    ) {
        _id
        _createdAt
        userId
        secret
        expire
    }
}
```

{% /multicode %}

# Login {% #login %}

After receiving your secret from an email, you can create a session.

{% multicode %}

```client-web
import { Client, Account } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>'); // Your project ID

const account = new Account(client);

const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const secret = urlParams.get('secret');
const userId = urlParams.get('userId');

const user = await account.createSession(userId, secret);
```
```graphql
mutation {
    accountCreateSession(
        userId: "unique()",
        secret: "[SECRET]"
    ) {
        _id
        _createdAt
        userId
        expire
        provider
    }
}
```
{% /multicode %}
