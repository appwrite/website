Permissions define who can access files within a bucket. By default **no permissions** are granted to any users, so no user can access any files.
Permissions exist at two levels, bucket level and file level permissions. 

In Appwrite, permissions are **granted**, meaning a user has no access by default and receive access when granted. 
A user with access granted at either bucket level or file level will be able to access a file.
Users **don't need access at both levels** to access files.

# Bucket level {% #bucket-level %}
Bucket level permissions apply to every file in the bucket. 
If a user has read, create, update, or delete permissions at the bucket level, the user can access **all files** inside the bucket.

Configure bucket level permissions by navigating to **Your bucket** > **Settings** > **Permissions**.

# File level {% #file-level %}
File level permissions grant access to individual files.
If a user has read, create, update, or delete permissions at the file level, the user can access the **individual file**.

File level permissions are only applied if File Security is enabled in the settings of your bucket.
Enable file level permissions by navigating to **Your bucket** > **Settings** > **File security**.

File level permissions are configured in individual [files](/docs/products/storage/permissions#file-level).
