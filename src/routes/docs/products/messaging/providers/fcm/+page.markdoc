Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) lets you send push notifications to your iOS, Android, and web apps through Appwrite Messaging.
Before you can deliver messages, you must connect to a messaging provider.

{% section #add-provider step=1 title="Add provider" %}

To add FCM as a provider, navigate to **Messaging** > **Providers** > {% icon icon="plus" size="m" /%} **Add provider** > **Push notification**.

Give your provider a name > choose **FCM** > click **Save and continue**. 
The provider will be saved to your project, but not enabled until you complete its configuration.
{% /section %}
{% section #configure-provider step=2 title="Configure provider" %}

In the **Configure** step, you will need to provide details form your Firebase console to connect your Appwrite project.

You will need to provide the following information from the **Firebase console**.
