---

Apple Push Notification service (APNs) lets you send push notifications to Apple devices like macOS, iOS, tvOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices.
APNs is a best-effort service, and will attempt to deliver you messages to your device when it's online and available again.
APNs will save the last [N] messages for [M] days and attempt delivery as soon as it's online.

{% section #add-provider step=1 title="Add provider" %}

To add APNs as a provider, navigate to **Messaging** > **Providers** > {% icon icon="plus" size="m" /%} **Add provider** > **Push notification**.
[SCREENSHOT]

Give your provider a name > choose **APNS** > click **Save and continue**. 
The provider will be saved to your project, but not enabled until you complete its configuration.
{% /section %}
{% section #configure-provider step=2 title="Configure provider" %}

In the **Configure** step, you will need to provide details form your Apple developer account to connect your Appwrite project with your
Apple developer account.
