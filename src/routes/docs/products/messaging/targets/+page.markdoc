title: Targets 
description: Manage avenues of communication by targetting user's device, email, or phone number in your notification and messages.
---
Targets are different ways a user can be reached.
For example, a user might have two emails, a phone number as well as a phone and a tablet with your app installed.
This means, the user has five different targets that you can deliver messages to.

# Topics and targets {% #topics-and-targets %}
A user can have multiple targets, such as emails, phone numbers, and devices with your app installed. 
These targets can subscribe to a topic, so when messages are published to a topic, all subscribed targets receive the message.

# Types of targets {% #types-of-targets %}

# Add a target {% #add-a-target %}
Before you can send messages, make sure you have the appropriate targets added for your user.
## Add email target {% #add-email-target%}
Verified emails for users that signed up with [email password](/docs/products/auth/email-password), 
[magic URL](/docs/products/auth/magic-url), and [email OTP](/docs/products/auth/email-otp) login will already have an email target.

## Add SMS target {% #add-sms-target%}
Verified phone numbers for users that signed up with [Phone OTP](/docs/products/auth/phone-sms) login will already have a phone target.

## Add push notification target {% #add-push-notification-target%}
Push notifications require configuration on both the Appwrite platform and your client app's code.
