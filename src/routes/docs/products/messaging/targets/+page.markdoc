Targets are different ways a user can be reached.
For example, a user might have two emails, a phone number as well as a phone and a tablet with your app installed.
This means, the user has five different targets that you can deliver messages to.

# Topics and targets {% #topics-and-targets %}
A user can have multiple targets, such as emails, phone numbers, and devices with your app installed. 
These targets can subscribe to a topic, so when messages are published to a topic, all subscribed targets receive the message.
