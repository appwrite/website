In Appwrite Messaging, you can use topics to deliver messages to groups of users at once.

# Topics and targets {% #topics-and-targets %}
A user can have multiple targets, such as emails, phone numbers, and devices with your app installed. 
These targets can subscribe to a topic, so when messages are published to a topic, all subscribed targets receive the message.

# Organizing topics {% #organizing-topics %}
A topic should have semantic meaning.
For example, a topic can represent a group of customers that receing a common announcemennt or publishing public updates.
It's important to keep privacy in mind when using topics. 
Prefer sending private information like chat messages by addressing individual targets attached to a user.

Topics are optimized for delivering the same message to large groups of users. 
If you need to deliver messages to **all devices of the same user**, you can find a user's targets by calling `account.get()`.
