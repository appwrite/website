title: Realtime
description: Explore the power of real-time communication with the Appwrite Realtime API. Learn how to build dynamic and interactive applications with real-time data updates.
---

Appwrite supports multiple protocols for accessing the server, including [REST](/docs/apis/rest), [GraphQL](/docs/apis/graphql), and [Realtime](/docs/apis/realtime). The Appwrite Realtime allows you to listen to any Appwrite events in realtime using the `subscribe` method.

Instead of requesting new data via HTTP, the subscription will receive new data every time it changes, any connected client receives that update within milliseconds via a WebSocket connection.

This lets you build an interactive and responsive user experience by providing information from all of Appwrite's services in realtime. The example below shows subscribing to realtime events for file uploads.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

// Subscribe to files channel
client.subscribe('files', response => {
    if(response.events.includes('buckets.*.files.*.create')) {
        // Log when a new file is uploaded
        console.log(response.payload);
    }
});
```

```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final realtime = Realtime(client);

// Subscribe to files channel
final subscription = realtime.subscribe(['files']);

subscription.stream.listen((response) {
    if(response.events.contains('buckets.*.files.*.create')) {
    // Log when a new file is uploaded
    print(response.payload);
    }
});
```

```client-apple
import Appwrite
import AppwriteModels

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let realtime = Realtime(client)

// Subscribe to files channel
let subscription = realtime.subscribe(channels: ["files"]) { response in
    if (message.events!.contains("buckets.*.files.*.create")) {
        // Log when a new file is uploaded
        print(String(describing: response))
    }
}
```

```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Realtime

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val realtime = Realtime(client)

// Subscribe to files channel
let subscription = realtime.subscribe("files") {
    if(it.events.contains("buckets.*.files.*.create")) {
        // Log when a new file is uploaded
        print(it.payload.toString());
    }
}
```

{% /multicode %}

To subscribe to updates from different Appwrite resources, you need to specify one or more [channels](/docs/apis/realtime#channels). The channels offer a wide and powerful selection that will allow you to listen to all possible resources. This allows you to receive updates not only from the database, but from _all_ the services that Appwrite offers.

If you subscribe to a channel, you will receive callbacks for a variety of events related to the channel. The events attribute in the callback can be used to filter and respond to specific events in a channel.

[View a list of all available events](/docs/advanced/platform/events).


{% info title="Permissions" %}
All subscriptions are secured by the [permissions system](/docs/advanced/platform/permissions) offered by Appwrite, meaning a user will only receive updates to resources they have permission to access.

Using `Role.any()` on read permissions will allow any client to receive updates.
{% /info %}

# Authentication {% #authentication %}

Realtime authenticates using an existing user session. If you authenticate **after** creating a subscription, the subscription will not receive updates for the newly authenticated user. You will need to re-create the subscription to work with the new user.

More information and examples of authenticating users can be found in the dedicated [authentication docs](/docs/products/auth).

# Examples {% #examples %}
The examples below will show you how you can use Realtime in various ways.

## Subscribe to a Channel {% #subscribe-to-a-channel %}
In this example we are subscribing to all updates related to our account by using the `account` channel. This will be triggered by any update related to the authenticated user, like updating the user's name or e-mail address.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

client.subscribe('account', response => {
    // Callback will be executed on all account events.
    console.log(response);
});
```

```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final realtime = Realtime(client);

final subscription = realtime.subscribe(['account']);

subscription.stream.listen((response) {
    // Callback will be executed on all account events.
    print(response);
})
```

```client-apple
import Appwrite
import AppwriteModels

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let realtime = Realtime(client)

let subscription = realtime.subscribe(channel: "account", callback: { response in
    // Callback will be executed on all account events.
    print(String(describing: response))
})
```

```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Realtime

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val realtime = Realtime(client)

val subscription = realtime.subscribe("account") {
    // Callback will be executed on all account events.
    print(it.payload.toString())
}
```

{% /multicode %}

## Subscribe to Multiple Channels  {% #subscribe-to-multiple-channel %}

You can also listen to multiple channels at once by passing an array of channels. This will trigger the callback for any events for all channels passed.

In this example we are listening to the document A and all files by subscribing to the `databases.A.collections.A.documents.A` and `files` channels.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

client.subscribe(['collections.A.documents.A', 'files'], response => {
    // Callback will be executed on changes for documents A and all files.
    console.log(response);
});
```

```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final realtime = Realtime(client);

final subscription = realtime.subscribe(['databases.A.collections.A.documents.A', 'files']);

subscription.stream.listen((response) {
    // Callback will be executed on changes for documents A and all files.
    print(response);
})
```

```client-apple
import Appwrite
import AppwriteModels

let client = Client()
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

let realtime = Realtime(client)

realtime.subscribe(channels: ["databases.A.collections.A.documents.A", "files"]) { response in
    // Callback will be executed on changes for documents A and all files.
    print(String(describing: response))
}
```

```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Realtime

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")
val realtime = Realtime(client)

realtime.subscribe("databases.A.collections.A.documents.A", "files") {
    // Callback will be executed on changes for documents A and all files.
    print(it.toString())
}
```

{% /multicode %}

## Unsubscribe {% #unsubscribe %}

If you no longer want to receive updates from a subscription, you can unsubscribe so that your callbacks are no longer called. Leaving old subscriptions alive and resubscribing can result in duplicate subscriptions and cause race conditions.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const unsubscribe = client.subscribe('files', response => {
    // Callback will be executed on changes for all files.
    console.log(response);
});

// Closes the subscription.
unsubscribe();
```

```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

final realtime = Realtime(client);

final subscription = realtime.subscribe(['files']);

subscription.stream.listen((response) {
    // Callback will be executed on changes for all files.
    print(response);
})

// Closes the subscription.
subscription.close();
```

```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
let realtime = Realtime(client)

let subscription = realtime.subscribe(channel: "files") { response in
    // Callback will be executed on changes for all files.
    print(response.toString())
}

// Closes the subscription.
subscription.close()
```

```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Realtime

val client = Client(context)
    .setEndpoint("https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")
    .setProject("<PROJECT_ID>")

val realtime = Realtime(client)

val subscription = realtime.subscribe("files") {
    // Callback will be executed on changes for all files.
    print(it.toString())
}

// Closes the subscription.
subscription.close()
```

{% /multicode %}

# Payload {% #payload %}

The payload from the subscription will contain following properties:

{% table %}
* Name
* Type
* Description
---
* events
* string[]
* The [Appwrite events](/docs/advanced/platform/events) that triggered this update.
---
* channels
* string[]
* An array of [channels](/docs/apis/realtime#channels) that can receive this message.
---
* timestamp
* string
* The [ISO 8601 timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) in UTC timezone from the server
---
* payload
* object
* Payload contains the data equal to the response model.
{% /table %}

If you subscribe to the `documents` channel and a document the user is allowed to read is updated, you will receive an object containing information about the event and the updated document.

The response will look like this:

```json
{
  "events": [
    "databases.default.collections.sample.documents.63c98b9baea0938e1206.update",
    "databases.*.collections.*.documents.*.update",

# Custom endpoint {% #custom-endpoint %}

The SDK will guess the endpoint of the Realtime API when setting the endpoint of your Appwrite instance. If you are running Appwrite with a custom proxy and changed the route of the Realtime API, you can call the `setEndpointRealtime` method on the Client SDK and set your new endpoint value.

By default the endpoint is `wss://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/realtime`.

{% multicode %}
```client-web
import { Client } from "appwrite";
const client = new Client();

client.setEndpointRealtime('wss://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/realtime');
```

```client-flutter
import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart';

final client = Client();
client.setEndpointRealtime('wss://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/realtime');
```

```client-apple
import Appwrite

let client = Client()
client.setEndpointRealtime("wss://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/realtime")
```

```client-android-kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client

val client = Client(context)
client.setEndpointRealtime("wss://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/realtime")
```

# Limitations {% #limitations %}

While the Realtime API offers robust capabilities, there are currently some limitations to be aware of in its implementation.

## Subscription changes {% #subscription-changes %}

The SDK creates a single WebSocket connection for all subscribed channels.
Each time a channel is added or unsubscribed, the SDK currently creates a completely new connection and terminates the old one.
Therefore, subscriptions to channels should always be done in conjunction with state management so as not to be unnecessarily
built up several times by multiple components' life cycles.

## Server SDKs {% #server-sdks %}

We currently are not offering access to realtime with Server SDKs and an API key.
