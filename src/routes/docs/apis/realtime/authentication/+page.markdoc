description: Learn how authentication works with Appwrite Realtime subscriptions and how to handle session-based access.
---

Realtime authenticates using an existing user session. If you authenticate **after** creating a subscription, the subscription will not receive updates for the newly authenticated user. You will need to re-create the subscription to work with the new user.

More information and examples of authenticating users can be found in the dedicated [authentication docs](/docs/products/auth).

{% info title="Permissions" %}
All subscriptions are secured by the [permissions system](/docs/advanced/platform/permissions) offered by Appwrite, meaning a user will only receive updates to resources they have permission to access.

Using `Role.any()` on read permissions will allow any client to receive updates.

# Session lifecycle {% #session-lifecycle %}

When working with Realtime subscriptions and authentication, keep the following in mind:

1. **Create session first** - Always authenticate the user before creating subscriptions that require access to protected resources.
2. **Re-subscribe on session change** - If a user logs out and a new user logs in, you must close existing subscriptions and create new ones for the new session.
3. **Handle session expiry** - If a session expires, subscriptions tied to that session will stop receiving updates. Listen for session-related errors and re-authenticate when needed.
