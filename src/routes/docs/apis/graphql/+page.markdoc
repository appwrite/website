Appwrite supports multiple protocols for accessing the server, including [REST](/docs/apis/rest), [GraphQL](/docs/apis/graphql), and [Realtime](/docs/apis/realtime). The GraphQL API allows you to query and mutate any resource type on your Appwrite server through the endpoint `/v1/graphql`. Every endpoint available through REST is available through GraphQL, except for OAuth.
