Improve the docs, add this guide.

We still don't have this guide in place, but we do have some great news. 
The Appwrite docs, just like Appwrite, is completely open sourced.
This means, anyone can help improve them and add new guides and tutorials. 

If you see this page, **we're actively looking for contributions to this page**.
