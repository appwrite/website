Create a Flutter project.

```sh
flutter create ideas_tracker && cd ideas_tracker
```

# Dependencies {% #dependencies %}

Then, add the Appwrite Flutter SDK to your project.

```sh
flutter pub add appwrite:12.0.3
```

We'll also need the `provider` package to manage the state of our app.

```sh
flutter pub add provider:6.1.2
```
