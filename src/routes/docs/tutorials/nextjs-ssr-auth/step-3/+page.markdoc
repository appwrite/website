description: Add authentication to a Next.js project using Appwrite.
step: 3

Before you can use Appwrite, you need to create the Appwrite `Client` and set the project ID and endpoint. 
The client is then used to create services like `Databases` and `Account`, so they all point to the same Appwrite project.

Create a function to build services you need in a file like `src/lib/server/appwrite.js` and **exporting the instances**.

```js
// src/lib/server/appwrite.js
"use server";
import { Client, Account } from "node-appwrite";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function createSessionClient() {
  const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT)
    .setProject(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT);

  const session = await cookies().get("my-custom-session");
  if (!session || !session.value) {
    throw new Error("No session");
  }

  client.setSession(session.value);

  return {
    get account() {
      return new Account(client);
    },
  };
}

export async function createAdminClient() {
  const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT)
    .setProject(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT)
    .setKey(process.env.NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY);

  return {
    get account() {
      return new Account(client);
    },
  };
}
```

As part of the function, set the current user's session if they are logged in. This is done by accessing the session cookie from the request and calling the `setSession(session)` with the cookie value.

{% info title="Appwrite client security" %}
Notice that `createAdminClient` and `createSessionClient` returns **a new instance** of the Appwrite Client.
When using Appwrite in server-integrations, it's important to **never share a `Client` instance** between two requests.
Doing so could create security vulnerabilities.

# Environment variables {% #environment-variables %}

`NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT` are environment variables that are exported in your project's [.env file](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$env-dynamic-public).

For example, your `.env` might look something similar to this.

```env
NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=<PROJECT_ID>
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` is the endpoint of your appwrite instance , and the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT` is the ID of the project you want to use. 
You can get the values for these variables from the Appwrite console.

The `NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY` is an Appwrite API key with the necessary permissions to create new sessions.

For this tutorial you'll need an API key with the following scopes:

| Category  {% width=120 %} | Required scopes    | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Sessions  | `sessions.write`    | Allows API key to create, update, and delete sessions. |
