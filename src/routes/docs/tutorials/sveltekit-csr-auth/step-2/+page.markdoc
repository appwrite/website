You can create a Svelte project using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project).

```sh
npm create svelte@latest
```

The command will give you a prompt with several project types. We'll be starting with a skeleton project.

The prompt will be something similar to this.

```sh
create-svelte version 3.2.0

┌  Welcome to SvelteKit!
│
◇  Where should we create your project?
│  my-svelte-project
│
◇  Which Svelte app template?
│  Skeleton project
│
◇  Add type checking with TypeScript?
│  Yes, using JavaScript with JSDoc comments
│
◇  Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar)
│  Add ESLint for code linting
│
└  Your project is ready!
```

After the prompt is finished, you can head over to the newly created project.

```sh
cd my-svelte-project
npm install
```

## Adding Appwrite to your Svelte app {% #adding-appwrite-to-your-svelte-app %}

Appwrite provides a Web SDK that can be used in your Svelte apps. You can use Appwrite by installing the Web SDK as an NPM package.

```sh
npm install appwrite@18.1.1
```
