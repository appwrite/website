Create an [Astro project](https://docs.astro.build/en/install/auto/#1-run-the-setup-wizard) using:

```sh
npm create astro@latest
```

The command prompt will be something similar to this.

```sh
Where should we create your new project? ./my-astro-project

How would you like to start your new project? Empty

Do you plan to write TypeScript? No

Install dependencies? Yes

Initialize a new git repository? Yes
```

After the prompt is finished, you can head over to the newly created project.

```sh
cd my-astro-project
```

# Install Appwrite {% #install-appwrite %}

Appwrite provides a Node SDK that can be used in your Astro apps. You can use Appwrite by installing the Node SDK as an NPM package. The Node SDK is intended for server-side use. If you want to use Appwrite in a client-side application, you should use the Web SDK instead.

```sh
npm install node-appwrite
```

# Add Node adapter to Astro {% #add-node-to-astro %}

To use Astro as an SSR framework, you need to add the Node adapter to your project. Run the following command:

```sh
npx astro add node
```
