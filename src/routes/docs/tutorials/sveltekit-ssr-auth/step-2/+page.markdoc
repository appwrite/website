step: 2
---


Create a Svelte project using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project).

```sh
npm create svelte@latest
```

The command will give you a prompt with several project types. We'll be starting with a skeleton project.

The prompt will be something similar to this.

```sh
create-svelte version 3.2.0

┌  Welcome to SvelteKit!
│
◇  Where should we create your project?
│  my-svelte-project
│
◇  Which Svelte app template?
│  Skeleton project
│
◇  Add type checking with TypeScript?
│  Yes, using JavaScript with JSDoc comments
│
◇  Select additional options
│  None
│
└  Your project is ready!
```

After the prompt is finished, you can head over to the newly created project.

```sh
cd my-svelte-project
npm install
```

# Install Appwrite {% #install-appwrite %}

Appwrite provides a Node SDK that can be used in your Svelte apps. You can use Appwrite by installing the Node SDK as an NPM package. 
The Node SDK is intended for server-side use. If you want to use Appwrite in a client-side application, you should [use the Web SDK instead](/docs/tutorials/sveltekit-csr-auth).

```sh
npm install node-appwrite@17.0.0
```
