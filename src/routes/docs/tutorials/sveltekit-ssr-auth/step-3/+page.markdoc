Before you can use Appwrite, you need to create the Appwrite `Client` and set the project ID and endpoint. 
The client is then used to create services like `Databases` and `Account`, so they all point to the same Appwrite project.

Create a function to build services you need in a file like `src/lib/server/appwrite.js` and **exporting the instances**.

As part of the function, set the current user's session if they are logged in. This is done by accessing the session cookie from the request and calling the `setSession(session)` with the cookie value.

{% info title="Appwrite client security" %}
Notice that `createAppwriteClient` returns **a new instance** of the Appwrite Client.
When using Appwrite in server-integrations, it's important to **never share a `Client` instance** between two requests.
Doing so could create security vulnerabilities.
{% /info %}

```js
// src/lib/server/appwrite.js
import { Client, Account } from 'node-appwrite';
import { APPWRITE_KEY } from '$env/static/private';
import { PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT, PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT } from '$env/static/public';

export const SESSION_COOKIE = 'my-custom-session';

export function createAdminClient() {
    const client = new Client()
        .setEndpoint(PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT)
        .setProject(PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT)
        .setKey(APPWRITE_KEY); // Set the Appwrite API key!

    // Return the services we want to use.
    return {
        get account() {
            return new Account(client);
        }
    };
}

export function createSessionClient(event) {
    const client = new Client()
        .setEndpoint(PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT)
        .setProject(PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT);

    // Extract our custom domain's session cookie from the request
    const session = event.cookies.get(SESSION_COOKIE);
    if (!session) {
        throw new Error("No user session");
    }

    client.setSession(session);

    // Return the services we want to use.
    return {
        get account() {
            return new Account(client);
        }
    };
}
```

## Environment variables {% #environment-variables %}

`APPWRITE_KEY`, `PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` and `PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` are environment variables that are exported in your project's [.env file](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$env-dynamic-public).

For example, your `.env` might look something similar to this.

```text
APPWRITE_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=<PROJECT_ID>
```

The `PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` is the endpoint of your Appwrite project, and the `PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT` is the ID of the project you want to use. 
You can get the values for these variables from the Appwrite console.

The `APPWRITE_KEY` is an Appwrite API key with the necessary permissions to read and write accounts and sessions.

For this tutorial you'll need an API key with the following scopes:

| Category  {% width=120 %} | Required scopes    | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Sessions  | `sessions.write`    | Allows API key to create, update, and delete sessions. |
