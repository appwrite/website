# Create React Native project {% #create-react-project %}

Create a React Native app with the `npm create` command.

```sh
npx create-expo-app ideas-tracker
cd ideas-tracker
```

# Add dependencies {% #add-dependencies %}

Install the React Native Appwrite SDK.

```sh
npx expo install react-native-appwrite react-native-url-polyfill
```

Then, install React Navigation to help implement simple navigation logic.

```sh
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
```

Install peer dependencies needed for React Navigation.

```sh
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

For iOS with bare React Native project, make sure you have CocoaPods installed. Then install the pods to complete the installation:

```
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```
