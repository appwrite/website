# Test your project {% #test-project %}
You can run your projects with `npm run start`. This will start the Metro bundler and open the Expo Go app on your device. 
You can also run your project on an emulator or simulator by pressing `i` for iOS and `a` for Android.

# Bundling for production {% #bundle-production %}
Appwrite's React Native SDK is designed to work with the Expo Metro bundler. 
When you are ready to build your app for production, you can learn more in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).
