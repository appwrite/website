# Create Nuxt project {% #create-nuxt-project %}

Create a Nuxt app with the `npx init` command.

```sh
npx nuxi@latest init ideas-tracker
```

# Add dependencies {% #add-dependencies %}

Install the JavaScript Appwrite SDK.

```sh
npm install appwrite
```

You can start the development server to watch your app update in the browser as you make changes.

```sh
npm run dev
```

# Set up files {% #set up-files %}

In Nuxt, directories help organize the codebase and minimize boilerplate.
The purpose is making it easy to find and manage different aspect of your application.

The files added to the `pages` directory will automatically become a route.
Nuxt will look for a layout in the `layouts` directory to render a page layout.
Without a layout file in this directory, the routing won't work
When these files have been created the `app.vue` file needs to edited to render these pages instead of the standard welcome page.
Then, we will have a working app where we can verify our changes in the browser throughout the tutorial.
As an additional step, we will be adding [Appwrite's Pink Design system]('https://pink.appwrite.io/') to have a global design system to help with the layout.

First, add a page by creating the file `src/pages/index.vue` and add the following code.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, idea tracker!</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

Create the file `src/layouts/default.vue` to add the default layout.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  layout: "default",
};
</script>
```

Go to `app.vue`, remove `NuxtWelcome`and insert `<NuxtPage />` wrapped inside `<NuxtLayout>`.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtLayout>
      <NuxtPage />
    </NuxtLayout>
  </div>
</template>
```

To import Appwrite's design system to all pages and components, edit the file `nuxt.config.ts`.
The layouts is then ready to be used in the templates with auto-import.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      link: [
        { rel: "stylesheet", href: "https://unpkg.com/@appwrite.io/pink" },
        {
          rel: "stylesheet",
          href: "https://unpkg.com/@appwrite.io/pink-icons",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  devtools: { enabled: true },
});
```
