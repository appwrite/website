 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate Appwrite's pagination methods into a React application. 
 Proper pagination ensures efficient data display, enhance user experience, and provide a smooth interface for navigating large datasets.

 While this is a React example, the same priciples should apply to any other framework or platform.

# Why pagination? {% #why-pagination %}
Pagination is critical in web development, especially when working with large datasets. 
It helps users explore and process data without feeling overwhelmed by breaking it down into smaller parts. 
With large data sets, it also lets you improve performance and lower resource use by fetching a small "page" of data to be processed at a time.
