# Wrapping up {% #wrapping-up %}
Pagination is a fundamental feature for applications that handle large datasets. By now, you should have a solid understanding of how to implement different pagination methods using Appwrite with React.
# Test your pagination implementation {% #test-your-pagination-implementation %}
Before deploying or integrating your pagination into a larger project, it's crucial to test it thoroughly:

 ```sh
 npm run dev -- --open --port 3000
 ```

 Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to interact with your application. Ensure that both offset and cursor pagination methods work as expected, and data loads correctly as you navigate through pages.

 To deepen your understanding and explore more advanced pagination techniques or nuances, refer to the official documentation:
[Appwrite pagination documentation](/docs/products/databases/pagination).

Remember, the choice between offset and cursor pagination will depend on your application's specific needs. Always consider the size of the dataset, user experience, and performance requirements when making your decision.
