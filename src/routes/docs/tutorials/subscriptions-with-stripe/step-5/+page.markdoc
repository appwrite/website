step: 5

You are now ready to use the Appwrite Function in your front end. You can initialize the payment process by redirecting your user to the `/subscribe` endpoint on the Function's domain.

# Visit demo {% #visit-demo %} 

You can visit our Function's domain in the browser to see the demo application.

In the demo app, click the **Register as anonymous** button to create a guest session. This will create a new user in your Appwrite Project. After registering, the demo app will show that you are **Not subscribed**. This means that your user does not have a `subscriber` label. You can click **Subscribe with Stripe** to start the payment process.

Once redirected to Stripe, fill out the payment form. If your Stripe account is in test mode, you can use test card number `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiration date and any CVC code. When done, click the **Subscribe** button.

Once processed, you will be redirected back to the demo application, where **Subscription status** will say **Subscribed**. If it doesn't, please allow Stripe a few moments to process the payment. You can keep refreshing the website until the status is updated.

# Verify label {% #verify-label %}

Once someone subscribes, they should receive a special label that will grant them permissions.
To verify that a label was added successfully to the user, 
you can switch to Appwrite Console and visit the **Auth** page of our Appwrite Project. 
Here, you should see one anonymous user. 

Let's click on this user to see the details. 
After scrolling down to the **Labels** card, you can see the `subscriber` label has been added to this user.
