These Terms and Conditions ("Terms," "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with [Appwrite (https://appwrite.io)](https://appwrite.io) website (the "Service") operated by Appwrite ("us," "we," or "our").

Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.



# Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscriptions"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Appwrite cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Appwrite customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Appwrite with accurate and complete billing information, including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Appwrite to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Appwrite will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.



# Fee Changes

Appwrite, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Appwrite will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.



# Refunds

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Appwrite on a case-by-case basis and granted in the sole discretion of Appwrite.
