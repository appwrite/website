# Overview

When creating products, accessibility can be an afterthought. Understandably, we want to ship our products fast and deliver value to our users. We might think that accessibility is needed for edge cases and therefore not prioritize it. It’s good to be reminded that the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 16% of the global population has some form of disability (Dec 2022).

# Services

Ignoring such a significant part of your user base simply doesn’t create a good user experience.Creating accessible products is everyone’s responsibility. Designers, developers, content authors, and whoever else is involved in creating products should do their part and strive towards achieving a better experience for everyone.
