Weâ€™ve expanded the Appwrite Cloud to a brand-new region.

Starting today, the **San Francisco (SFO)** region is now live and ready for your projects.

This means you can:

- Create new projects directly in SFO
- Or [migrate](/blog/post/change-regions-with-migrations) your existing projects to take advantage of the new location

If your users are on the U.S. West Coast, the SFO region will help you deliver a faster and reliable experience to your users.
