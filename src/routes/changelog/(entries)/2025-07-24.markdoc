We’re excited to announce that Appwrite Sites is now available for everyone to use.

You can now host your websites and web apps directly from Appwrite.

Here is a recap of everything we’ve added to Sites:

* Static hosting: Ideal for single-page applications (SPAs), landing pages, documentation sites, and any project that compiles to static files.
* Server-side rendering (SSR): Full support for frameworks like Flutter, React, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, Remix, and more right out of the box.
* Git integrations: Connect your GitHub repository to enable automatic deployments on every push.
* Deployment previews: Get a unique preview URL for each pull request—review, test, and merge with confidence.
* Global CDN: Distribute your content worldwide with a powerful content delivery network to ensure low-latency access from anywhere.
* DDoS protection: Built-in protection mechanisms to help safeguard your apps from denial-of-service attacks.
* The Appwrite Network: Take advantage of many cloud regions, Points of Presence (PoPs), and edge network capabilities, reducing latency and enhancing performance globally.
* The Appwrite DNS: Appwrite provides a dedicated DNS (Domain Name System) service through its appwrite.zone nameservers to help you manage domain records for your applications.
* Sites templates: We created ready-to-use customizable templates that you can deploy with one click, directly from Appwrite.
