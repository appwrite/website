To ensure the sustainability of Appwrite Cloud as it continues to scale, we're introducing pricing for image transformations starting April 1st, 2025.

## What's changing

- **Origin images used in transformations** will now be counted toward usage and billed according to your plan
- **Pro and Scale plans** will include 100 origin images per month at no additional charge
- **Additional origin images** will be available at $5 per 1,000 images

## What you should do

Review your current image transformation usage through your organization's usage page or the usage section of specific projects to understand your usage patterns and plan accordingly.
