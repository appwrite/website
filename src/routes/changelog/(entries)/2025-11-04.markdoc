title: "Announcing DB operators: Update multiple fields without fetching the entire row"
date: 2025-11-04

---
Updating just one field in a row, like incrementing a counter or adding a tag, used to require reading and rewriting the entire document. This added latency, wasted bandwidth, and created risks of lost updates under high concurrency.

**What’s new:**

- Introduced DB Operators v1, enabling inline, atomic field-level updates.
- Support for numeric, array, string, and date operations.
- Perform multiple field updates in a single atomic call.
- Type-safe SDK methods for clarity and safety.
- Transaction-ready, can be combined with other database operations.

**Immediate benefits**

- Always consistent. No race conditions or lost updates.
- Lower latency and bandwidth usage.
- Cleaner, more expressive code. One call, clear intent.
- Composable updates across multiple fields.

Live now on Appwrite Cloud. Coming soon to self-hosted deployments.
