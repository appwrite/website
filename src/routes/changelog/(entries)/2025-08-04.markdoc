Introducing: Atomic numeric operations

A new Database feature that lets you increment or decrement numeric fields directly on the server, without fetching the full document. Itâ€™s fast, safe, bandwidth-efficient, and concurrency-friendly.

Before this feature, updating a number meant fetching the entire document, modifying it on the client, and writing it back, a process prone to race conditions, unnecessary bandwidth use, and extra logic to handle edge cases.

With **Atomic numeric operations,** you simply send a delta (like `+1` or `-3`), and Appwrite applies the update atomically on the server. No full document reads, no conflicts, no custom logic. Just consistent, permission-aware updates that work reliably under load.

This feature is now live for both **Appwrite Cloud** and **Self-Hosted** environments.
