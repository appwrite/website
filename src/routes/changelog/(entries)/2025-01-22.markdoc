We've introduced new additions to Appwrite Messaging that give you greater control over how you send and handle push notifications in your apps.

## What's new

- **Background updates for iOS**: We've added support for silent background updates on iOS, with equivalent data-only notifications available for Android.
- **Critical alerts for iOS**: You can now send notifications that bypass Do Not Disturb and notification settings.
- **Priority controls for all platforms**: We've added options to manage delivery speed and battery usage across platforms.
- **Badge numbers for iOS**: The badge parameter now accepts integers instead of strings for better type safety.
- **Optional title and body for all platforms**: You can now send notifications without title and body for background and data-only updates.

These updates will help you build better notification experiences for your users. Try them out and share your feedback with us.
