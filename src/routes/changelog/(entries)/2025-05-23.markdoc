Until now, sharing files from Appwrite often meant navigating permissions, managing access, or making files public, even when all you wanted was to send a file to someone outside your project. We introduce a new feature that will make file sharing a whole lot easier.

Introducing **File Tokens.**

This feature lets you share files easily and securely**,** without modifying permissions or changing project access. Just generate a token and share the link.
