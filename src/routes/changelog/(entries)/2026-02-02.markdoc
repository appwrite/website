You can now run introspection queries on Appwrite's GraphQL API. With introspection enabled, you get:

- **IDE autocomplete** for queries, mutations, and fields
- **Schema exploration** using tools like GraphQL Playground, Insomnia, or Postman
- **Type generation** for strongly-typed clients in your preferred language

To try it out, send an introspection query to your project's GraphQL endpoint:

```client-web
import { Client, Graphql } from "appwrite";

const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1')
    .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>');

const graphql = new Graphql(client);

const schema = await graphql.query({
    query: `{
        __schema {
            types { name }
            queryType { fields { name } }
            mutationType { fields { name } }
        }
    }`
});

console.log(schema.data);
```
