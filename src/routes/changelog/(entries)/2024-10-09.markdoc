Today, Appwrite expands the Cloud Function ecosystem with a new, powerful runtime that offers developers simplicity and securityâ€”introducing Deno support.

With [Deno](https://deno.com/), you can write modern, fast, and secure cloud functions in JavaScript and TypeScript, which includes all-in-one tooling such as a [linter](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/linter/), [test runner](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/test/), [formatter](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/formatter/) and more, as well as [web standards API support](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/web_platform_apis/).
