We're introducing a new way to populate your Appwrite databases: **document imports from CSV files**.

Using this feature, you can now import documents into your database using just a CSV file without any custom scripts.

Whether youâ€™re:

- Migrating data from another tool
- Seeding test environments
- Importing FAQs, inventory, or structured content

You can do it all with a simple CSV file.
