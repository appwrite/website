Appwrite Databases now supports filter queries directly on relationship columns using dot notation. Query across related data with operators like `equal`, `notEqual`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan`, `between`, and more, without needing to fetch and filter application-side.

Additionally, all relationship operations are now 12-18x faster across the board, with no configuration changes needed.

Now live on Appwrite Cloud.
