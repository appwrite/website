title: "Announcing HEIC and AVIF support: modern image formats now in Appwrite"

Weâ€™re excited to share we have added support for two new image formats in Appwrite Storage: **HEIC** and **AVIF.** This will give you more tools to manage, manipulate, and serve images the way you need.

You can generate image previews directly in **.heic** and **.avif** formats, which are natively supported in Appwrite.

No converters. No extra steps. Just fast, flexible image handling built in.
