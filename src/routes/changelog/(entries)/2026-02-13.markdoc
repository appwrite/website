Appwrite Realtime now includes Channel helpers, a fluent, type-safe API for building channel subscriptions. Instead of manually writing channel strings, you use the `Channel` class with IDE autocomplete and compile-time validation.

Channel helpers support all available channels, event type filtering with `.create()`, `.update()`, and `.delete()`, and flexible wildcards by omitting IDs. Existing string-based subscriptions continue to work.

Available across all Appwrite client SDKs: Web, Flutter, Apple, and Android.

Now live on Appwrite Cloud.
