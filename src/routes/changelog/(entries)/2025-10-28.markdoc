[TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) is quickly becoming the go-to framework for developers who want simplicity, type safety, and performance without the overhead.

# What’s new

- **Full SSR support for TanStack Start**: Deploy TanStack Start apps directly on Appwrite Cloud with zero configuration.
- **Native Cloud support**: Everything works out of the box on Appwrite Cloud, no additional setup required.

It’s now available on Appwrite Cloud.
