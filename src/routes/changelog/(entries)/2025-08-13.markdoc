Weâ€™re excited to announce one more powerful addition to Appwrite Databases: **Timestamp Overrides**

In many data workflows, imported records automatically take on the date and time they are added to the new system. While fine for some cases, this can cause issues when migrating data or integrating systems where original timestamps matter for accurate audit trails, analytics, and chronological order.

**With Timestamp Overrides,** you can manually set `$createdAt` and `$updatedAt`when importing or creating documents, ensuring your data history stays true from the start.

Available on **Cloud** and will soon be coming to **Self-Hosted** in the next release.
