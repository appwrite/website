We're excited to introduce another Appwrite Databases feature, **Bulk API**.

Previously, writing or modifying large amounts of data in Appwrite Databases required sending one request per document.

With the new Bulk API, you can create, update, or delete multiple documents in one go, vastly speeding up your workflows and reducing network overhead.
