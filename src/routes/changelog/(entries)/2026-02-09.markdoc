title: "Generate a type-safe SDK from your schema with the Appwrite CLI"
date: 2026-02-09

---

The Appwrite CLI now includes a `generate` command that creates a type-safe, project-aware SDK directly from your database schema. The generated SDK includes typed helpers with autocomplete for querying and mutating rows, eliminating boilerplate and turning schema-related runtime bugs into type errors.

Run `appwrite generate` in your project directory to get started.

Now live on Appwrite Cloud.
