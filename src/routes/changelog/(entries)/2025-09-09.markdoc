While the Appwrite docs are constantly getting updated and improved, LLMs often struggle to provide accurate and up-to-date information due to missing context.

Appwrite's new MCP server for docs solves this problem by enabling AI assistants to access and search through Appwrite's documentation directly.

With this MCP server, AI assistants can:

- Search through Appwrite documentation
- Retrieve specific guides and references
- Generate code snippets using the latest APIs
- Provide contextual help for Appwrite features

This makes it easier for developers to get instant, accurate answers about Appwrite directly from their AI development environment.
