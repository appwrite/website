We are about to blow your socks off with what comes next for Appwrite. 

Init brings you a new week of major announcements from 19-23 May 2025. For those new to [Init](/blog/post/announcing-init): it’s the start of something new here at Appwrite as we announce new products and features every day, for a week. 

We can’t disclose anything just yet, but we can say that this launch will forever change the way you build with Appwrite. A major stepping stone into a new Appwrite era, all with one mission of making software development accessible and fun for all.
