---

Handling multi-step workflows across tables often means dealing with partial writes and manual rollback logic.  

With the new **Transactions API**, you can now execute multiple operations as a single atomic action, either all succeed or none do.

# What's new:

- New Transactions API for managing multi-step writes  
- Support for staging multiple `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations across tables  
- Atomic commit and automatic rollback on failure  
- Configurable timeout for idle transactions (default: 5 minutes)

# Benefits:

- **ACID compliance:** Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability across all staged operations.  
- **All-or-nothing writes:** Prevents partial data states and inconsistent records.  
- **Automatic rollback:** Appwrite handles cleanup on failure, no manual scripts required.  
- **Reduced race conditions:** All operations are validated and committed together.  
- **Simplified logic:** Consolidate multi-table operations without adding client-side complexity.

This update is live on Appwrite Cloud.
