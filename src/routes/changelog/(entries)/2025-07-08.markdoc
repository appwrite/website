We're excited to introduce Database Upsert in Appwrite.

You can now create or update a document in a single API call. If the document does not exist, it is created. If it does, it is updated. The server handles all the logic for you.

This feature can help reduce the number of network calls and allow race-free writes, simplifying your database interactions overall.
