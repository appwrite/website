A new set of database queries, **time helper queries**, is now live.

Filtering by time is one of the most common patterns in real-world apps. Until now, this often meant adding extra conditions that made your queries longer and harder to read.

With time helper queries, you can now handle time-based filtering in a simple and expressive way. Youâ€™ll find four new options:

- `createdBefore`: Find rows created before a given date
- `createdAfter`: Find rows created after a given date
- `updatedBefore`: Find rows updated before a given date
- `updatedAfter`: Find rows updated after a given date

That means you can:
- Reduce boilerplate in your code
- Write cleaner, more readable queries
- Make time-based filtering faster and easier to manage

Available now on **Appwrite Cloud and Self-hosted.**
