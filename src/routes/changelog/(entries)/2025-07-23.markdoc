title: "Pricing update to Appwrite's Free plan"
date: 2025-07-23

Starting September 1st, 2025, the Free plan will be limited to two projects per organization. Projects will never be paused.


**What does this mean for developers on the Free plan?**

If you have more than two projects in your organization on a Free plan, **you’ll have full access to all of them until the 1st of September 2025.** After that, you’ll need to reduce the number of projects to two or fewer, or upgrade to a paid plan.

You can pick which ones to keep in your Appwrite Console as of today.

Everyone on the Free plan has received an email with detailed information. Did you not receive this email? Let us know at billing@appwrite.io.

**Keeping Appwrite sustainable**

We built Appwrite with the help of the open-source community for all developers, from students to enterprises and everything in between. Ensuring that all developers can benefit from Appwrite will always be our priority. 
Appwrite’s Free plan will continue to provide the tools you need to start building real apps, without compromising on core capabilities. 
All the core building blocks of Appwrite, Databases, Authentication, Storage, Functions, Messaging, and Sites will remain available on the Free plan.

If you have questions, need help planning, or want to discuss custom needs, please contact us at billing@appwrite.io. We’re here to support you through the transition and ensure you can keep building without interruptions.

Thank you for being part of this journey with us.
