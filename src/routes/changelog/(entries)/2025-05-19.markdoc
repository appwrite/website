You love using Appwrite to power your backend, but when it’s time to actually *ship* your website, you’re bouncing between tools, platforms, and extra accounts. That ends today.

Introducing **Appwrite Sites**.

A new Appwrite product that lets you deploy and host your websites and web apps *right inside Appwrite*. No more juggling services. No more gluing things together. No more multiple subscriptions. Just build, deploy, and go live. All in one place, and it's 100% open source, the kind that lets you (really) self-host and (really) own your data.
