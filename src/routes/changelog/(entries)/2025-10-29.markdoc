Weâ€™ve expanded the Appwrite Cloud to two brand-new regions!

Starting today, the Singapore (SGP) and Toronto (TOR) regions are live and ready for your projects.

This means you can:
Create new projects directly in the regions SGP or TOR.

Or migrate your existing projects to take advantage of these new locations.

If your users are based in Southeast Asia, the Singapore region will help you deliver a faster and more reliable experience.
If your users are in Canada or the U.S. Northeast, the Toronto region will help you do the same, closer to where your users are.
