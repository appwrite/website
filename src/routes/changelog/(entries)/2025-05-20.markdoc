Appwrite Sites now offers native support for Flutter web applications. This new feature allows you to deploy Flutter web applications directly from your Appwrite projects with seamless backend integration.

With framework auto-detection and optimized build settings, you can now extend your Flutter applications to the web while leveraging the same Appwrite backend services you use for mobile apps.
