Weâ€™ve listened to your feedback and are introducing two new features designed to simplify phone authentication testing and bolster account security.

Mock numbers allow you to set up a list of phone numbers with a predefined, static verification code, which is perfect for app reviews and testing. Session alerts will help your users maintain their account security.
