Appwrite Sites now supports Next.js applications built with Turbopack, with faster builds and better compatibility for your deployments.

## What's new
- **Turbopack support**: Deploy Next.js SSR sites using Turbopack bundler for faster builds
- **Better Next.js compatibility**: Developers no longer need to disable Turbopack in build commands

## Benefits
- **Faster builds**: Turbopack is faster than webpack
- **Better developer experience**: No build configuration changes needed when deploying applications that use Turbopack

This update is live for all Appwrite Cloud users. Self-hosted support will come in an upcoming release.
