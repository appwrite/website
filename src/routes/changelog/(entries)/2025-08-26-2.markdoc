Announcing significant updates to Appwrite Databases!

Appwrite Databases is now transitioning to a more familiar relational model, moving away from the documents and collections terminology.

Here’s what’s changed:

- Collections → Tables
- Documents → Rows
- Attributes → Columns

This makes it easy for you to work with structured data while maintaining backwards compatibility.

To support the terminology change, we’ve added the **TablesDB API**.

A new API layer that helps you work with relational database concepts like tables, columns, and rows, without requiring any changes to your existing apps. 

While old collection methods still work with essential security & maintenance. All new features will now land in the TablesDB API.
