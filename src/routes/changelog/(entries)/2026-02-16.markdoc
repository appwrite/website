Appwrite Realtime now supports passing SDK queries when subscribing to channels. Events are filtered server-side based on your queries, so your callbacks only receive updates that match your conditions.

You can use queries like `Query.equal()`, `Query.notEqual()`, `Query.greaterThan()`, and more, and combine them with `Query.and()` and `Query.or()` for precise filtering. You can also subscribe to the same channel multiple times with different filters to handle different subsets of events independently.

Available across all Appwrite client SDKs: Web, Flutter, Apple, and Android.

Now live on Appwrite Cloud.
