We’re happy to share that Appwrite Cloud users now have full WebP support across all versions of Safari browsers and devices.

WebP’s superior compression reduces image sizes by up to 30%, improving page load times, bandwidth usage, and overall performance.

This update is now available to all Appwrite Cloud users and provides faster delivery and greater efficiency for developers across all platforms.
