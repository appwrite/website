Appwrite Cloud now offers Database Backups, providing a more secure way to protect your data. Backups are encrypted, run without downtime, and are stored in a remote location to ensure full redundancy.

Automated backup policies allow you to schedule regular backups, with additional flexibility available for Scale and Enterprise plans.

This feature is available for all paid plans and can be managed directly from the Appwrite Console.
