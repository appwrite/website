title: "Advanced filtering across the Console"
date: 2026-02-17

Debugging and monitoring just got easier. The Appwrite Console now supports advanced filtering for function executions, site logs, and deployments.

Filter by status, trigger type, HTTP method, response status code, duration, request path, or time range, and combine multiple filters to quickly find exactly what you need.

For example, surface all failed function executions from the last hour, or find slow site requests exceeding 5 seconds. 

Now live on Appwrite Cloud.
