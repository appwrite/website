title: "Free Plan Update: Automatic Pausing of Inactive Projects"
date: 2026-02-20
---

To reduce idle infrastructure costs and keep the Free plan sustainable at scale, projects on the Free plan with no development activity for 7 consecutive days will be automatically paused.

**What “paused” means**

- Data is not deleted
- The project is not accessible to users while paused
- No background processes run (backups, cron jobs, scheduled functions)
- Projects can be reactivated anytime from the Appwrite Console and become active immediately

**Why this change**
Running cloud infrastructure incurs ongoing costs, even for inactive projects. Automatically pausing idle projects ensures resources are prioritized for developers actively building, while keeping the Free plan sustainable long term.

**Important**
Projects that require continuous availability should be on a paid plan. Free plan projects remain active as long as they show development activity in the Console.
We will continue evolving the Free plan to keep it generous, sustainable, and aligned with active builders.
