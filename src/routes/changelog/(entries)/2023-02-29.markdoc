Weâ€™re excited to announce the addition of two new database operators for performing queries, the `or` and `contains` operators for Appwrite Databases. 

You can now:

- Perform a broader search by matching against any text within a substring
- Group queries together for advanced filtering and search capabilities

With these new database improvements you have more possibilities for data retrieval and manipulation, and add powerful new queries and logic to Appwrite Databases for you to manage your data.
