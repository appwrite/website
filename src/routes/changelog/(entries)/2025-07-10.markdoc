Weâ€™re adding another layer of security to the Appwrite database: Encrypted string attribute support.

Now you can mark sensitive fields, like full names, admin notes, or IP addresses, to be encrypted at rest, without writing a single line of encryption logic.

Key Features:

- Server-side AES-128-GCM encryption
- Non-queryable for added protection
- Simple setup via Appwrite Console

Available on Appwrite Cloud Pro and Scale plan, and self-hosted.
