title: "Announcing inversion queries: Exclusion rules made simple"

Excluding data often meant fetching too much and then filtering it out in your app, which wasted reads and added extra logic.

To make those exclusions simpler and more efficient, we’ve added **inversion queries**:

- `notSearch`
- `notContains`
- `notBetween`
- `notStartsWith`
- `notEndsWith`

With these, you can express “everything except …” rules directly in your queries, keeping them cleaner, reducing wasted reads, and cutting down on payload sizes.

Now live on **Appwrite Cloud + Self-hosted**.
