We’re excited to introduce a completely new TablesDB UI for Appwrite Databases

Experience a spreadsheet‑like editing workflow, right inside the Console.

You can now:

- Edit records inline
- Perform bulk actions
- Navigate with arrow keys and shortcuts

A faster way to patch production, clean up test data, and stay in flow.
