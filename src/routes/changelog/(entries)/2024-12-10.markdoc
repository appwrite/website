You can now manage memberships privacy across all Appwrite plans, helping you protect sensitive member details.

With this feature, you can mark specific membership details like the user's name, email, and multi-factor authentication status as private.

To configure these settings, head to **Auth > Security > Memberships Privacy** in the Console.

If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know on [Discord](https://appwrite.io/discord).
