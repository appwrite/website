Appwrite now supports Deno 2.0 for local function development. When you run `appwrite init functions`, you'll see Deno as an available runtime option. This allows you to develop and test your functions locally using Deno's modern, secure, and fast runtime.

With Deno 2.0, you can take advantage of built-in tools like the linter, test runner, and formatter, making local development much easier.
