This release introduces AI-assisted schema generation to simplify database schema creation.

**What’s new:**

- Added **Database AI suggestions** in the Console
- Automatic column and index suggestions based on table name and context
- Added sample data generation when creating a new table, allowing you to quickly populate example records that match the schema
- Example: Creating a table called `Orders` suggests columns `orderId`, `userId`, `totalAmount`, and `status`

**Benefits:**

- Faster setup: Define schemas in seconds instead of manually creating each column
- Consistency: Field names and types aligned across tables
- Best practices: Suggested indexes and common fields included by default
- Flexibility: Suggestions can be reviewed, modified, or skipped before applying

This update is available now on the Appwrite Console.
