We're excited to introduce a new Database feature: Auto-increment support.

This new feature automatically handles a `$sequence` column in your collection that increments with each new document insertion. This ensures your data remains ordered without additional manual overhead.

Auto-increment is perfect for use cases like:

- Paginated data sets
- Invoice numbers and activity logs
- Ordered timelines
