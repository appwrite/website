We've added new DNS records to improve security and reliability for Appwrite domains.

# What's new {% #what-s-new %}
- **CAA records** are now included, strengthening security by controlling which certificate authorities can issue SSL certificates for your domains.
- **AAAA records** have been added, providing better reliability with IPv6 support.

These changes give you more flexibility and help reduce the chance of misconfigured certificates or DNS errors.
