title: "New string column types for Appwrite Databases"
date: 2026-02-12

---

Appwrite Databases now supports four explicit string column types - `varchar`, `text`, `mediumtext`, and `longtext` - giving you transparent control over storage behavior and indexing.

Each type has defined limits and indexing strategies suited to different use cases, from short identifiers to large content. The legacy `string` type remains supported for backward compatibility.

Now live on Appwrite Cloud.
