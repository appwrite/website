We're excited to announce the **Screenshots API**, a new addition to Appwrite Avatars that lets you generate fully customizable webpage screenshots with a single API call.

No more headless browser infrastructure to maintain. No more environment-specific workarounds. Just simple, reliable screenshot generation.

# What you can do

- Capture any public webpage as an image
- Control browser viewport size and device scale
- Render in light or dark theme
- Simulate different locales, timezones, and geolocation
- Pre-grant browser permissions
- Generate full-page or viewport-only screenshots
- Customize output format, dimensions, and quality

The Screenshots API is available today as part of Appwrite Avatars and is already being used in production by [Imagine](https://imagine.dev).
