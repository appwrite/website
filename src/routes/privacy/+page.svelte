                                Data. When Appwrite engages in such transfers of Personal Data, it
                                relies on i) Adequacy Decisions as adopted by European Commission on
                                the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) (for
                                example, when we access from Israel), or ii) Standard Contractual
                                Clauses issued by the European Commission. Appwrite also continually
                                monitors the circumstances surrounding such transfers in order to
                                ensure that these maintain, in practice, a level of protection that
                                is essentially equivalent to the one guaranteed by the GDPR.
