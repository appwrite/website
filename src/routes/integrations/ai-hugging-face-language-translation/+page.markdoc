Language translation is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves converting text from one language to another. Hugging Face offers a robust library of pre-trained models for various natural language processing tasks, including language translation. By integrating Hugging Face's advanced models with your applications, you can automate and enhance translating text across different languages.

# How does the integration work?

You can utilize a pre-built Appwrite function template to add language translation with Hugging Face to your app. This will allow you to translate text from one language to another.

# How to implement

To implement the Hugging Face language translation function, there are several steps you must complete:

## Step 1: Sign up for Hugging Face

First, you must [sign up for a Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join). Once your account is set up, visit your profile settings, head to the [Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) page, and create an **access token** with **Inference** permissions. Save this token for further usage.

## Step 2: Create the Appwrite Function

For this step, you must [create an account on Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/register) or [self-host Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) if you haven’t already. If you decide to self-host Appwrite, there are [additional setup steps](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/functions) to use Appwrite Function templates.

Head over to the Appwrite console, navigate to the **Functions** page, click the **Templates** tab, and search for the **Language Translation** function template.

During the setup process, add the **Hugging Face access token** in the **Variables** step.

Then, create a new repository with the default branch and root directory settings. You can edit this repository later to update the function logic.

## Step 3: Test the function

Once the function is ready, visit the **Domains** tab on the **Functions** page and copy the domain URL to test the function. You can open this URL in your browser to test with our pre-built interface.

You can also use tools like Postman, cURL, or your favorite programming language to send a POST (HTTP) request with a prompt and receive a response from the function.

```bash
curl -X POST http://DEPLOYED_FUNCTION_DOMAIN \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"source": "What is Appwrite?"}' 
```
