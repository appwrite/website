This comprehensive tool is tailored for digital entrepreneurs, allowing them to focus on creating content while Lemon Squeezy handles the technical aspects of online sales.

# How does the integration work?

You can utilize a pre-built Appwrite function template to enable subscriptions via Lemon Squeezy in your app. This will allow you to accept recurring payments from your customers and grant them extra permissions.

# How to implement

To implement the Lemon Squeezy subscriptions integration, there are several steps you must complete:

## Step 1: Setup Lemon Squeezy

First, [sign up on Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/) and add a new store. 

![Lemon Squeezy dashboard](/images/integrations/lemon-squeezy-subscriptions/dashboard.png)

From your Lemon Squeezy dashboard, save the following details for further usage:

| Field name |  |
| --- | --- |
| Variant ID | Head to **Store** > **Products** from the left sidebar. Create a new product with the pricing type as **Subscription** and add all other mandatory details such as name, price, payment schedule, and tax category. Click on the product dropdown menu (…) to get the variant ID. |
| Store ID | Head to **Settings** > **Stores** from the left sidebar. The store ID will be a number visible next to your store’s URL. |
| API key | Head to **Settings** > **API** from the left sidebar. Create a new API key. |
| Webhook secret | Head to **Settings** > **Webhooks** from the left sidebar. Add a temporary endpoint `https://temporary-endpoint` (we will replace this with our final endpoint later), create a new webhook secret, and select the events `subscription_created` and `subscription_expired`. |

## Step 2: Create the Appwrite Function

For this step, you must [create an account on Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/register) or [self-host Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) if you haven’t already. If you decide to self-host Appwrite, there are [additional setup steps](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/functions) to use Appwrite Function templates.

Head over to the Appwrite console, navigate to the **Functions** page, click the **Templates** tab, and search for the **Subscriptions with Lemon Squeezy** function template.

During the setup process, click the checkbox to generate an Appwrite API key on completion and add the **Lemon Squeezy API key**, **webhook secret**, **store ID**, and **variant ID** in the **Variables** step. If you are self-hosting Appwrite, click on the **optional variables** dropdown and update the Appwrite endpoint to your instance’s publicly accessible endpoint. 

![Env variables](/images/integrations/lemon-squeezy-subscriptions/variables.png)

Then, create a new repository with the default branch and root directory settings. You can edit this repository later to update the function logic. Once the function is deployed, go to the **Domains** tab on the **Function** page, copy the domain, and update it in your **Webhooks settings** in the following format:

```bash
https://DEPLOYED_FUNCTION_DOMAIN/webhook
```

Additionally, edit the product you created and add your function URL as the **Button link** under the **Confirmation modal** section.

## Step 3: Test the function

Once all the steps are complete, it is time to test the function! First, copy the function URL, go to the **Appwrite project dashboard**, and add it to the **Platforms** section as a web app. This will register your function URL as an authorized hostname to interact with Appwrite (to prevent CORS).

![Add web platform](/images/integrations/lemon-squeezy-subscriptions/web-platform.png)

Then, open it in your browser to test the function and access the pre-built interactive UI. You can anonymously log in through this UI and create a subscription using [Lemon Squeezy's test card number](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/getting-started/test-mode#test-card-numbers). As soon as this process is complete, the function UI will show that you are subscribed. 

![Demo](/images/integrations/lemon-squeezy-subscriptions/demo.png)

Additionally, your user on Appwrite will feature the `subscriber` label, which you can verify by visiting the **Auth** page in your Appwrite project and clicking on the user.
