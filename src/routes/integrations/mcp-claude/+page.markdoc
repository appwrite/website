Claude Desktop is a standalone application by Anthropic that allows users to interact with the Claude large language model directly from their Mac or Windows desktops. Designed for convenience and speed, it offers a distraction-free chat experience, supports multiple conversations, and runs natively for faster performance and system integration. Whether you're brainstorming, coding, summarizing documents, or automating workflows, Claude Desktop makes it easy to harness AI assistance without relying on a browser.

# How does the integration work?

The Appwrite MCP server integrates with Claude Desktop using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing you to connect your Appwrite project to Claude Desktop.

This integration enables you to perform various operations on your Appwrite resources, such as creating users, managing databases, and more, directly from Claude Desktop using natural language commands.

# How to implement

To implement the MCP with Claude Desktop integration, there are several steps you must complete:

## Step 1: Create an Appwrite API key

First, you must [create an account on Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/register) or [self-host Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) if you haven't already.

Select your project (or create a new one), and head to the **Overview** page from the left sidebar. Under the **Integrations** section, click on the **API Keys** tab, and then click on **Create API Key**. Select the scopes for whichever Appwrite services you want to work with, set the duration, and create the API key. You must then copy it for future usage.

Then, head to the **Settings** page from the left sidebar, and copy the **Project ID** and **API Endpoint** for future usage.

## Step 2: Configure the MCP server on Cursor

{% info title="Pre-requisite: Install uv" %}

You must install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) on your system to use the MCP server.

To configure the MCP server on Claude Desktop, head to the app's **Settings** page (press `CTRL + ,` on Windows or `CMD + ,` on MacOS), navigate to the **Developer** tab, and click on **Edit Config**. This will open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file, where you must add the following:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "appwrite": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "mcp-server-appwrite",
                "--users"
            ],
            "env": {
                "APPWRITE_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
                "APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID": "<your-project-id>",
                "APPWRITE_ENDPOINT": "https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration will set up the MCP server to connect to your Appwrite project using the API key, project ID, and endpoint, which you must update before saving and exiting the file.

You may have noticed the `--users` argument, which enables Claude Desktop to interact with the Appwrite Users API. To enable other Appwrite services, you can add their respective [command-line arguments](/docs/tooling/mcp#command-line-arguments).

Once you have updated and saved the `claude_desktop_config.json` file, restart Claude Desktop and click on the MCP tools button (at the bottom right section of the prompt input) to view the available MCP tools.

## Step 3: Test the integration

Finally, you can test the integration by asking Claude Desktop to list all the users in your Appwrite project.
