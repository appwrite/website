An Apple ID is a unique account that allows access to Apple services, including the App Store, iCloud, iTunes, Apple Music, and more. It serves as a key to the Apple ecosystem, allowing users to synchronize their data across Apple devices, download apps, purchase music, and access various features like FaceTime and iMessage. The Apple ID consists of an email address and a password, with options for added security through two-factor authentication. It is essential for managing personal information, subscriptions, and settings across all Apple products.

# How does the integration work?

You can use the Apple OAuth adapter in Appwrite Auth for user authentication and management. This can be convenient for users because they can start using your app without creating a new account. It can also be more secure, because the user has one less password that could become vulnerable.

# How to implement

To implement the Apple OAuth adapter in Appwrite Auth, there are several steps you must complete:

## Step 1: Create an Apple Developer account

First, [sign up for the Apple Developer program](https://developer.apple.com/programs). 

![Apple Developer Program](/images/integrations/oauth-apple/apple-developer-program.png)

Before you configure any other details, you must create an **App ID** for our app. To do that, go to XCode and open the `ios` folder in your source code. Navigate to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, click the ➕ **Capability** button, search for `Sign in with Apple`, and double-click the result to add it. Then, modify the **Bundle Identifier** to a unique string by prefixing it with any letters of your choice and change the **Team** to your Apple Developer team. This will automatically create an **App ID** for your app.

After that, you will also need to create a **Services ID**. Visit your Apple Developer account, head to **Program resources** > **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** > **Identifiers**, and register a new **Service ID**, setting your Bundle ID as the unique identifier. 

View the service ID, enable **Sign in with Apple**, and in its configuration, select your primary App ID, input `appwrite.io` (or the domain of your self-hosted instance) under **Domains and Subdomains,** and temporarily add the URL `https://temporary-endpoint.com/` under **Return URLs**. This temporary URI will be replaced with the final URI once the OAuth2 adapter is configured on Appwrite.

Head to your Apple Developer account and save the following details:

| Field name |  |
| --- | --- |
| Services ID Identifier | Head to Apple Developer account > Program resources > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Identifiers and view the Services ID. |
| Team ID | Head to Apple Developer account > Membership details > Team ID |
| Authentication key (.p8 file) | Head to Apple Developer account > Program resources > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Keys. Create a key and give it a name. Enable Sign in with Apple and register your key. Download the key, open it in a text editor, and copy the content. |
| Authentication key ID | Head to Apple Developer account > Program resources > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Keys. Click on your key to view details. |

## Step 2: Add Apple OAuth adapter to your Appwrite project

For this step, you must [create an account on Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/register) or [self-host Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) if you haven’t already. In your Appwrite project, head over to the **Auth** page, open the **Settings** tab, and click on Apple under the **OAuth2 Providers** section.

![Apple provider](/images/integrations/oauth-apple/provider.png)

Add the **Services ID Identifier** (in the Bundle ID field), **Key ID**, **Team ID**, and **P8 File** content that you saved from your Apple Developer account. Copy the URI and add it to the **Return URLs** in the configuration of the Services ID you created in your Apple Developer account.

## Step 3: Test the provider.

Follow the [OAuth 2 login](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/oauth2#init) flow to test your provider.
