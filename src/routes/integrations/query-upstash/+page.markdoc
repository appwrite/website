Upstash Vector provides a powerful vector database designed to handle complex queries and search functionalities. It’s ideal for applications that require fast and efficient handling of vector data.

# How does the integration work?

You can utilize a pre-built Appwrite function template to integrate an Upstash Vector database with your app. This setup enables you to store and query vector data efficiently, enhancing your application's search and recommendation features.

# How to implement

To implement the Upstash Vector integration, follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Set up the Upstash Vector database

First, [create an account on Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/login) and set up a **new Vector index** with your preferred region and embedding model. Once it is ready, copy your **endpoint** and **token** from the index’s dashboard for further usage

## Step 2: Create the Appwrite Function

For this step, you must [create an account on Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/register) or [self-host Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) if you haven’t already. If you decide to self-host Appwrite, there are [additional setup steps](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/functions) to use Appwrite Function templates.

Head over to the Appwrite console, navigate to the **Functions** page, click the **Templates** tab, and search for the **Upstash** function template.

Add the **Upstash endpoint** and **token** you saved in the **Variables** step. Then, create a new repository with the default branch and root directory settings. You can edit this repository later to update the function logic.

## Step 3: Test the function

Once the function is ready, visit the **Domains** tab on the **Functions** page and copy the domain URL to test the function. Sending a GET (HTTP) Request to this endpoint will add a randomly generated mock embedding and query for the one most similar entry in the database.

```bash
curl DEPLOYED_FUNCTION_DOMAIN \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

You can add other database functionalities by editing the function generated on GitHub.
