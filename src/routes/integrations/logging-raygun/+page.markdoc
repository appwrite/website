# How does the integration work?

If you are using self-hosting Appwrite, you can use the Raygun provider for error-tracking and logging for your Appwrite instance.

# How to implement

To implement the Raygun provider for logging, there are several steps you must complete:

## Step 1: Sign up for Raygun

First, [sign up on Raygun](https://app.raygun.com/signup?product=cr) (pick **Crash Reporting** as the product you're most interested in) and create your first application. Head to **Application settings** from the left-side navbar and copy your **API Key**.

## Step 2: Add Raygun provider to your Appwrite instance

For this step, you must [self-host Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting) if you haven't already.

The Appwrite logging configuration uses a DSN format that follows the pattern `raygun://API_KEY/`. Use your Raygun API key in the DSN.

Visit the `.env` file created for your Appwrite instance and update the following environment variable:

```bash
_APP_LOGGING_CONFIG=raygun://API_KEY/
```

{% info title="Using Appwrite < 1.5.6?" %}
For versions prior to 1.5.6, use the old syntax format:
```bash
_APP_LOGGING_PROVIDER=raygun
_APP_LOGGING_CONFIG=RAYGUN_API_KEY
```
{% /info %}

After that, run the following Docker Compose commands in your terminal to restart your Appwrite containers and verify if the changes have been successfully applied:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
docker compose exec appwrite vars
```

## Step 3: Test the provider

Once the Raygun provider is configured, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker compose exec appwrite ssl --domain="wrongdomain.com"
```

Doing so will show errors in your Raygun Crash Reporting dashboard.
