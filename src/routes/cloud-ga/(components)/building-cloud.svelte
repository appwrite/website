                        When we started working on our plans for Appwrite Cloud, we knew we had a
                        hard task ahead of us, as we didn’t want to just be a wrapper on top of AWS
                        or Cloudflare. With no vendors to lean on, we wanted to customize every
                        piece in the platform to create the most complete developer experience we
                        can imagine.

                    <p class="text-white">
                        We wanted to create a developer experience that rethinks how an idea goes to
                        production and scale, without worries, without limits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another benefit of this approach is the ability to control the cost of
                        building with Appwrite as we reduce vendor dependency. Making Appwrite’s
                        pricing more accessible as part of our mission.

                        Together with the open-source community, Appwrite Cloud has reached General

                        GA with you.

                    To become Generally Available, we set a few milestones that we had to achieve
                    across different factors. Some are easier to measure than others, but never less
                    important.
