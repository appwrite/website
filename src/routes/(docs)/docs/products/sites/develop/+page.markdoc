# Rendering strategies

Appwrite allows you to host both statically-generated and server-rendered websites. 

[Static sites](/docs/products/sites/rendering/static) are websites that are pre-built and served as-is to clients. They do not execute server-side code on each request. They are ideal for use-cases such as [Single Page Applications (SPAs)](/docs/products/sites/rendering/static#running-spas-on-appwrite-sites), documentation sites, personal blogs, and portfolio websites. 

[Server-side rendered (SSR) sites](/docs/products/sites/rendering/ssr) generate content dynamically on the server and send fully rendered pages for each request. They are ideal for use-cases with substantial dynamic content or server-side processing such as e-commerce platforms, social media applications, content management systems (CMS), and real-time collaboration tools.

You can configure your preferred rendering strategy through the following steps:

1. Navigate to your site on Appwrite Console.
2. Head to the **Settings** tab > **Build settings** section.
3. Select the SSR or the Static checkbox.
4. Confirm that the appropriate install command, build command, and output directory are set.
5. *(For SPAs)* Add a fallback file.
6. Click on the **Update** button and redeploy your site.

# **Accessing environment variables**

Appwrite Sites lets you set static environment variables to pass constants and secrets such as API keys, connection strings, etc., to your sites.

To set static environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your site on Appwrite Console.
2. Head to the **Settings** tab > **Environment variables** section.
3. Click on the **Create variable** button and add the key and value of the environment variable.
4. Select the **Secret** checkbox if you want to prevent any team member from reading the value of the environment variable after creation.
5. Click on the **Create** button and redeploy the site.

{% only_dark %}
![Environment variables](/images/docs/sites/dark/env-variables.png)
{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}
![Environment variables](/images/docs/sites/env-variables.png)
{% /only_light %}

You can also configure global variables that apply to all your sites in the **Settings** of your project.

{% info title="Secret environment variables" %}

Appwrite now allows you create secret environment variables, which are hidden from both the Appwrite Console and API. Once a variable is marked as secret, this action cannot be reversed.

You can mark an environment variable as secret either at the time of creation or after it is created.

{% /info %}

## Appwrite-specific environment variables

Appwrite passes the following environment variables into every deployed site by default.

{% partial file="sites-env-vars.md" /%}

# Timeouts

Each request made to a path on an Appwrite Site has a set time limit, after which the request will timeout. Here are the steps to configure those timeout period:

1. Navigate to your site on Appwrite Console.
2. Head to the **Settings** tab > **Timeout** section.
3. Add an appropriate time limit (in seconds).

{% only_dark %}
![Timeout](/images/docs/sites/dark/timeout.png)
{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}
![Timeout](/images/docs/sites/timeout.png)
{% /only_light %}

The default timeout is set at `15 seconds` and the maximum value possible is `30 seconds`.

# Project dependencies

To install your dependencies before your site is built, you should add the relevant install command to your site’s build settings. Here are the steps to add the install command:

1. Navigate to your site on Appwrite Console.
2. Head to the **Settings** tab > **Build settings** section.
3. Confirm that the appropriate install command is set.

{% only_dark %}
![Install command](/images/docs/sites/dark/build-settings-install-command.png)
{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}
![Install command](/images/docs/sites/build-settings-install-command.png)
{% /only_light %}

Make sure to include dependency files like `package.json` in your site's configured root directory. Do not include the dependency folders like `node_modules` in your site’s root directory. The dependencies installed for your local OS may not work in the site's environment.

Your site's dependencies should be managed by the package manager of each language. We include the following package managers and setup commands by default.
