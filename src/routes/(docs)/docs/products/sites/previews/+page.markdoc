If you create a new Pull Request on the GitHub repo for your site, Appwrite Sites will create a preview deployment that you can view and test before promoting to production.

# Visit preview deployments

To access a preview deployment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your site on Appwrite Console.
2. Under the **Deployments** tab, click on a ready deployment.
3. Click on the **Visit** button. This preview URL is also visible under the **Domains** section.

{% only_dark %}
![Preview deployment](/images/docs/sites/dark/preview-deployment.png)
{% /only_dark %}
{% only_light %}
![Preview deployment](/images/docs/sites/preview-deployment.png)
{% /only_light %}

Appwrite Sites will then verify whether you are authorized to access the Appwrite project in which the site is deployed and allow you to access this preview accordingly.

## Deployments for GitHub

Aside from the preview URL, Appwrite also generates a [URL for the branch and commit](/docs/products/sites/domains#branch-and-commit-urls) that your site has been deployed from. To access these URLs, you can head to the **Deployments** tab of your site, head to any active deployment created using the Git integration, and click on the **+2** next to the mentioned domain in the **Domains** section.

You can also directly access the branch and commit that these deployments are created from, by clicking on **GitHub** under the **Source** section.
