title: Deploy from CLI
description: Learn to deploy Appwrite Sites from the Appwrite CLI.
---

Appwrite Sites allows you to host and deploy websites directly within the Appwrite platform. Each site can have many deployments, which can be thought of as versions of the web application.

While we recommend you create deployments through [automatic Git deployments](/docs/products/sites/deploy-from-git), you can also create deployments via the Appwrite CLI.

# CLI  {% #cli %} 

{% partial file="cli-sites.md" /%}

## Configure CLI deployments {% #configure-cli-deployments %}
If you need to target a different project, API endpoint, change the path or entry point of your site, or update any of the other configuration options, 
you can do so by editing the `appwrite.config.json` file.

# Debugging

- If you updated your site's configuration but the deployment is not working as expected, you may need to first redeploy your site before the changes take effect.
