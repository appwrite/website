Migrations make it as easy as a couple of clicks to move all your Appwrite Cloud data into a self-hosted instance.

{% section #notices step=1 title="Things to keep in mind" %}

1. Data transferred by migrations will reset `$createdAt` and `$updatedAt` timestamps to the date of the migration.

2. Your self-hosted Appwrite project must be accessible from the internet for the migration to work.

3. Migrations are non-destructive. No data will be deleted or lost in the source project.

1. Once redirected to your self-hosted project, you'll be prompted to select an organization and a project. You can migrate to an existing project or create a new one.

1. Select the data you wish to migrate. You can choose among accounts, databases, documents, files, and functions.

1. Click **Start Migration** to start the migration process. You do not need to keep the Appwrite Console open through the process.

{% info title="Keep in mind" %}
Your self-hosted instance will generate an API Key in the background to pass to Appwrite Cloud. You can revoke this key after the migration process is complete.
