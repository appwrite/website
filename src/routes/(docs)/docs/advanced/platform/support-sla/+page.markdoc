---

This Support Service Level Agreement ("SLA") describes the support services provided by APPWRITE ("we," "us," or "our") to users of our products and services ("you" or "user"). By using our services, you agree to the terms of this SLA.

## Scope

This SLA outlines our commitments for providing support services via email, including response and resolution processes based on issue severity. The specific response times depend on the support tier associated with your subscription: **Pro**, **Scale**, or **Enterprise**.

## Severity levels

Support issues are categorized into the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: System is down or a critical component is non-functional, causing a complete stoppage of work or significant business impact.
- **High**: Major functionality is impaired, but a workaround is available, or a critical component is significantly degraded.
- **Medium**: Minor functionality is impaired without significant business impact.
- **Low**: Issue has minor impact on business operations; workaround is not necessary.
- **Question**: Requests for information, general guidance, or feature requests.

## Response time targets

| Severity | Pro | Scale | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | Unsupported | 1 hour (24/7/365) | 15 minutes (24/7/365) |
| High | Unsupported | 4 hours (24/7/365) | 1 hour (24/7/365) |
| Medium | 2 business days | 1 business day | 12 hours (24/7/365) |
| Low | 3 business days | 2 business days | 24 hours (24/7/365) |
| Question | 4 business days | 3 business days | 1 business day |

## Business hours and days

Our standard business hours are from **9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Pacific Time**, Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays. Enterprise and Scale customers receive extended support 24/7/365.

## User responsibilities

To ensure effective support, users are expected to:

- Provide detailed information about each issue, including screenshots, error messages, logs, and steps to reproduce the problem.
- Ensure relevant personnel are available to assist in diagnosing and resolving issues.
- Implement reasonable recommendations provided by our support team.

## Limitations and exclusions

- This SLA applies only to support requests submitted via the Appwrite Console.
- SLA obligations may be affected by factors outside our reasonable control, including but not limited to force majeure events, third-party dependencies, or actions taken by the user.

## Modifications

We reserve the right to modify this SLA at any time. Changes become effective upon posting to our website. Your continued use of our services after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated SLA.
