You can create functions using the CLI without needing to access the Console.

{% partial file="cli-disclaimer.md" /%}

To deploy your function with the Appwrite CLI, use the `appwrite init functions` command to create a starter function and paste your code into the generated file and folder.

```sh
appwrite init functions
```
To deploy the generated code, add any dependencies and push the function using the following command:

```sh
appwrite push functions
```
