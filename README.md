The Appwrite Website repo features the main Appwrite website, including our [homepage](https://appwrite.io), [docs](https://appwrite.io/docs), and upcoming blog.

The Appwrite Website has been built with the following frameworks:

-   [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
-   [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
