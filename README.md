The Appwrite Website repo features the main Appwrite website, including our [homepage](https://appwrite.io), [docs](https://appwrite.io/docs), and upcoming blog.

The Appwrite Website has been built with the following frameworks:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## Development

_If this is your first time setting up the repository, please run `pnpm install` inside the repo's directory and create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`._

To get the repo up and running in your local environment, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

> If you don't have `pnpm` available on your system, you can install it from the [official pnpm Installation website](https://pnpm.io/installation)
